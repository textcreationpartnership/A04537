            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <salute>To the Chriſtian Reader, grace and peace from our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THere came out of late (good Reader) two books, from one <hi>Mayſter Henry Iacob,</hi> a Prieſt of the Orders of the Prelates. The firſt was agaynſt his Lord, Mr D. Bilſon, now Prelate of Wincheſter, <hi>concerning Chriſts ſuffrings and deſcending into Hell.</hi> The latter agaynſt me by name, and others like mynded, <hi>tovvching the Church and Miniſtery of England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now although the Prelates could not well be offended at him, for publiſhing the former agaynſt the doctrine of theyr Church, ſenig (<note n="*" place="margin">In K. Edvv tyme, about 50. Yeares ſynce.</note> long before him) <hi>Mr Carlill</hi> a learned man had both publikly diſputed in Cambridge, and printed a book, agaynſt that error of <hi>Chriſts deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> and that with great approbation of the moſt godly and learned at that tyme: Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fearing the worſt, and knowing the hatred of the Prelates how deadly it is, he did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after ſend forth his other book, in defence of the Churches and Miniſtery of England. So as whatſoever diſpleaſure his Lords the Prelates conceyved agaynſt him for the former, there was now ſome hope that they might ſooner be appeaſed vpon view of the latter. Or howſoever it ſhould fall out, yet what like lyer way could he take, to make all ſure on his ſide, then by the firſt book to get the forward Preachers and profeſſors to take his part agaynſt the Prelates, and by the other to have both them and the Prelates themſelves to ſtand with him agaynſt vs?</p>
                  <p>Yet I heare ſome of his owne coat give out, that he hath dealt very ſimply, in publiſhing ſo weak and raw a Treatiſe againſt vs. And true it is in deed, that his Treatiſe is ſuch. In the publiſhing whereof, no wiſedome hath he ſhewed at all: vnles it be in this, that he hath thus let all the world ſee, that againſt <hi>the errors of the Church of England</hi> there is plenty of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be had and vrged, but not a jote to be found for defence of <hi>theyr VVorſhip, Miniſtery, conſtitution, &amp;c.</hi> For (if you mynd it)<note n="†" place="margin">Yet I deny not but he hath ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors alſo in that book.</note> in his book againſt Bilſon, about the queſtion of Chriſts ſuffrings and deſcending into Hell, you ſhall ſee proof after proof readily brought from the word of God. And on the contrary, in his book againſt vs, not onely no ſuch proof, but in ſtead thereof, eyther his owne aſſertions and compariſons obtruded vnto vs as oracles: or the Names of <hi>Mr Cranmer, Mr Ridley,</hi> and other dead men, oppoſed to the word of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God: or putting over his cauſe to the State to be defended, himſelf being not able to ſpeak one poore word in defence thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such is his latter book, and ſuch are the grounds of it. A very great and ſtraunge difference, between two books, ſet out by one and the ſame man, the one ſtraight after the other, and both of them in matter of Religion.</p>
                  <p>If I had firſt publiſhed theſe Replyes and Aunſwers which paſſed between vs, no doubt but many would have had a prejudice thereof, and all would have thought I had done it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to ſhew the weaknes of that cauſe and falſehood of that Miniſtery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now when he, a member of that Church, yea a Miniſter of it, even a Prieſt of the Prelates crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath firſt publiſhed them: albeit the ſame thing be done, yet it is both without all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and pretended by him for <hi>defence of the Churches and Miniſtery of England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Be it, that he hath not done it ſo well, as many would have it: yet it is the beſt he could. And what if he thought by this meanes, eyther to ſtirre vp ſome others more able herevnto. or at leaſt to ſhew his owne good will? Doubtles where there is want of ability, a mans good will is to be accepted. And why ſhould any then miſinterpret ſo good a meaning? If any of the Prelates or others of that Church like it not, they may learne by his example iff not to lay theyr hand on theyr mouth, yet to try if they can plead the cauſe any better. For worſe. I ſuppoſe they would be aſhamed to do it.</p>
                  <p>I had thought in this caſe I ſhould never have ſeen any more abſurd writing, then <hi>Mr Giffards and Bredvvels.</hi> But now to <hi>Mr Iacob</hi> may they well give place. And iff any can be found of all the Prieſts in England more ſenceleſſe then theſe, let ſuch for theyr worthynes (as
<pb facs="tcp:177485:3"/>
ſtanderd bearers) be Prelates of theyr chiefeſt Seas. And as for <hi>Mr Iacob,</hi> ſeing he hath done his beſt, let all men be content to beare with his ſimplicity, who otherwiſe might well note his folly, for vndertaking iuſ how the defence of that, which yet in deed he leaveth alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether naked and helples.</p>
                  <p>By the <hi>title of his book,</hi> it ſeemeth he thought to carry away the ſimple Reader, who eyther could not or would not mynd what ſhould follow after it.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>the book it ſelf,</hi> he thinketh his plea to be very good, if he can ſay for the Miniſtery and other abominations of theyr Church, <hi>They are errors, but not fundamentall: ſinnes againſt the Second commandement, but not vtterly aboliſhing from Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> And this is the ſumme of his whole book. A plea which he counteth vnaunſwerable. Yet in deed no other, but ſuch as openeth a wide doore for all maner <hi>errors and ſinnes</hi> to be receyved and nouriſhed amonge them which themſelves ſhall preſume not to be <hi>fundamentall, &amp;c.</hi> So that now theyr Church is ready (when they pleaſe) to entertayne agayne the offices of <hi>Abbats, Monks, Fryers, Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Cardinals &amp;c.</hi> the doctrines and practiſe of <hi>Auricular confeſſion: Prayer in an vnknovven toungue: Prayer for the dead: Seven Sacraments: Holy vvater: holy aſhes, holy palmes, holy bread: Creame, ſpittle, oyle, and ſalt in Baptiſme: Conſubſtantiation: Deniall of the cup to the lay people: Denyall off vvarres and Magiſtracy in Chriſtians: Denyall of Mariage in Miniſters, &amp;c.</hi> For theſe and many mo errors of the <hi>Papiſts, Lutherans, Anabaptiſts,</hi> it is like they hold not to be <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall,</hi> And therefore although theyr Church receyve them, yet is <hi>Mr Iacobs defence</hi> as ſound for them then, as it is now: Neyther may any for theſe or the like ſeparate from theyr Church, worſhip, or Miniſtery, if you will beleev him. Yet note, that for proof of this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you muſt let them take day. For as yet they can ſhew you none.</p>
                  <p>And what now, if any of the <hi>errors</hi> which the Church of England at this day retayneth be <hi>fundamentall?</hi> What will Mr Iacob ſay to that? Then agayne he is at a flat <hi>Non plus,</hi> and all his book is not worth a ruſh, ſave that it yeelds vs the cauſe, and graunts theyr Church to be a falſe Church, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d theyr people to be no true Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in that eſtate. For this therefore ſee what is ſayd in the Treatiſe hereafter following, Pag. 22. 114. 147. 148.</p>
                  <p>What alſo if <hi>D. Bilſon</hi> ſhould aunſwer <hi>Mr Iacob.</hi> for that poynt of Chriſts deſcenſion into Hell, as he aunſwereth vs for theyr Church corruptions, <hi>that though it be an error, yet it is not fundamentall, yea and that they in K. Edvvards dayes held it, Mr Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, &amp;c.</hi> Would Mr Iacob take this of his word, or think it a ſufficient warant for the holding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off, or bynd others to be likewiſe mynded <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to let this paſſe, let Mr Iacob mynd well the eſtate and practiſe of theyr Church, but in ſuch particulars, as I have named hereafter, <hi>Pag.</hi> 63. 64. 65. and then let him aunſwer as before God, Are they lawfull, or vnlawfull? Are they of Chriſt, or Antichriſt? Of God or the Divell? Lead they to heaven. or hell? May they be found in the Word and Churches of God, or in the Popes Churches, Canons, Portuis, Pontificall? May they any maner way be approved and communicated withall, or are they not wholy and with deteſtation to be refuſed and abhorred?</p>
                  <p>For aunſwer hereof I will wayte, till Mr Iacob reply agayne. And in the meane tyme I will now aunſwer what he and his Prefacemaker have already publiſhed. Where firſt I deſier the Reader, in both of them, and in <hi>Bridges, Bancroft, Bilſon, Hooker, Sutcliff,</hi> and all ſuch writers of that Church, to mynd theſe three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That all theyr reaſoning and perſwaſions are no other, but ſuch as may lead men, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther backe agayne to Popery, or the ready way to Atheiſme, or at leaſt to receyve whatſoever religion the Prince pleaſeth, ſo themſelues account it not to be <hi>fundamentall.</hi> Thus are they all blynd guydes: Thus do they all teach to continew in ſinne. Thus do they ſhut vp the kingdome of heaven before men, neyther entring in themſelues, nor ſuffring them that would enter, to come in.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they do even ſet themſelues to carpe at the truth it ſelf, and at the mayntenance and practiſe thereoff. To which end they vſe they care not what objections, and abuſe they care not whom.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That they never do ſo much as offer to bring proof from the Scripture for theyr eſtate and practiſe. See the particulars afterward rehearſed, <hi>Pag.</hi> 63. 64. 65. And mynd iff there be any of them all, that in any book they have written<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have brought warrant for them from the word of God. Onely <hi>D. VVhitgift</hi> made an aſſay for ſome of them: but he was ſo taken downe by <hi>Mr Cartvvright,</hi> as he was glad to lay downe the bucklers, which ſynce that tyme neyther himſelff nor any other durſt take vp. And now Sutcliffe himſelff can tell them, iff
<pb facs="tcp:177485:3"/>
Mr Cartwright have the better hand of D. Whitgift, that then <hi>the Church of England is no true Church of Chriſt,</hi> and that <hi>there is iuſt cauſe to departe and ſeparate from it.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sut. Engl. b. Pag. 228.</note>

Secondly, I would deſier the Reader not to be caried away with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of corruptions, from the Queſtion or matter in hand, (viz. Whether the good doctrines of the Churches of England are ſufficient to ſalvation in them that in ſimplicitie of heart beleeve &amp; imbrace them, notwithſtnding the multitude of errors and corruptions which Maiſter Iohnſon repeateth to the contrary:) But to have an eſpeciall regard vnto the ſame. Which is the maine poinct that hath &amp; doeth altogeather deceive them, viz. To have an eye to the corruptions in the Miniſtery, worſhip, &amp; governement of the Churches of England; But never to looke vnto the nature &amp; force of them, whether <hi>ſimply</hi> of their owne nature, they overthrow faith &amp; Chriſtianity, or whether they be held of obſtinacy &amp; a convicted conſcience, or not. Therefore I pray you marke &amp; examine the errors which they reckon vp, (&amp; I deſire the ſame alſo of them, for whoſe good eſpecially I publiſhed this Treatiſe.) And after due conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſee if thoſe errors are ſimply of that nature which before we have noted. If they be not, (as Maiſter Iohnſon nor all the men in the world, ſhall ever be able to prove they are:) Then do they gett no aduantage by thoſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, to this purpoſe which they vrge them for, although they were Thrice as many<note n="*" place="margin">Notvvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they are to many already.</note> more as they are. Thus they may ſee how they have all this while ben deceived, &amp; are now to ſeeke a new for defence of their ſeparation. For I hope they will not ſay, That every error, held in ſimplicitie by Chriſtians, doth cut them off from ſalvation in Chriſt; Then ſhould they condemne themſelves,
<pb facs="tcp:177485:5"/>
vnleſſe they hold Anabaptiſticall perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which ſurely though I thinke they hold not ſimply in their conſciences; Yet in their practize (by condemning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo peremptorily, that jump not even with them in every poinct) they come very neare it: But let this paſſe; wee ſee then, That of neceſſitie, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the errors muſt be regarded, Euery ſinne is not alike. Me thinkes then, that they ſhould affoard that favour to others, which they would have others affoard vnto them: namely, That as they would be accompted true Chriſtians, through their faith in Chriſt, notwithſtanding their errors (which they muſt acknowledge<note n="*" place="margin">Pſ. 19.12. 1 Cor. 13.9.12.</note> are infinite many in this life.) So they ſhould accompt of others in the like caſe: which even common ſence &amp; humanitie would require them to graunt.</p>
                              <p>To impreſſe this thing a little better in their myndes, I will a little turne my ſpeach vnto them. And I would pray them, to call to mynde the many errors &amp; corruptions which they beare with amonge themſelves, &amp; lay them &amp; the errors with vs togeather, &amp; they ſhall ſee their equality.</p>
                              <p>Some of you, hold it vtterly &amp; ſimply vnlawfull, to ſweare by a booke, to prove a will, take an adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or ſue in the Eccleſiaſticall Courts: To ſhut vp your ſhops vpon Holly dayes &amp; Feſtivall dayes, &amp;c.

This ſecond note of his, is as fooliſh, as frivolous, as contumelions, as the former. See it here, in his chaunging of the queſtion between vs: in his leſſening of theyr corruptions: in his miſmatching of things vnequall: in his abuſing our difference of judgement, and reviling off vs: in his perverting the Scriptures, and example of the Martyrs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">The <hi>Queſtion</hi> between vs, is not as he pretendeth, but thus: Firſt concerning them, <hi>VVhether the good doctrines of the Church of England being joyned together vvith theyr Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian errors and corruptions, do make theyr Aſſemblyes and people in that eſtate to be true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Chriſtians.</hi> Then concerning vs, <hi>VVhether notvvithſtanding the good doctrines pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in theyr Church, vve may and ought to ſeparate from theyr Antichriſtian Miniſtery, vvorſhip, confuſion &amp;c.</hi> That thus the queſtion ſtandeth between vs, themſelves cannot deny: though they ſeek to alter and turne from it here and every where. Therefore do we alſo deſier thee (good Reader) to mynd it well and not to be carryed away (with the view of theyr good doctrines alone) from the queſtion and matter in hand: but alway to have an eſpeciall regard therevnto.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding if the queſtion were as here he pretendeth, perthen both his owne and all <hi>Mr Iacobs</hi> defence of the Church of England is even thus alſo quite ouerthrowen. For now it appeareth that both of them do vnderſtand theyr Argument following, as if it were thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded:</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever is ſufficient to make a particular man a true Chriſtian and in ſtate of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that is ſufficient to make a company ſo gathered together, to be a true Church,<note place="margin">Mr Iacobs Argument: as it is novv vnderſtood by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the multitude of errors and corruptions retayned among them.</p>
                  <p>But the whole doctrine, as it is publikly profeſſed, and practiſed by Law in England, is ſufficient to make a particular man a true Chriſtian and in ſtate of ſalvation. <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch a one as in ſimplicity of heart beleveth and embraceth it): And the publik Aſſemblyes of England are in theyr eſtate companyes ſo gathered together (that <hi>is,</hi> they do in ſimplicity of heart ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev and embrace).</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is ſufficient to make the publik Aſſemblyes of England true Churches, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the multitude of theyr errors and corruptions.</p>
                  <p>The Argument then being thus propounded, as by this note of his it muſt needs be, marke (I pray you) what followeth herevpon. 1. That as it hath ben propounded hitherto, it concludeth not the Queſtion, but is lame both in the <hi>Propoſition</hi> and <hi>Aſſumption:</hi> as I have noted more particularly hereafter. <hi>Pag.</hi> 4. 10. 12. 13. 93. 97. 99. 106.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That in theyr eſtate we muſt mynd, not theyr good doctrines alone, but theyr errors and corruptions withall. Of which there is never a word in all theyr Argument. See it, <hi>Pag.</hi> 3: 4. 63. 171. 172.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the falſehood both of the <hi>Propoſition</hi> and <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is now ſo manifeſt, as the very propounding of them thus, is ſufficient to refute them. But for this alſo ſee further, <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. 11. 12. 13. Now to ſpeak here but of the latter braunch of the Aſſumption onely, let them tell vs, iff themſelues think theyr Aſſemblyes and members thereof, do in ſimplicity of heart beleev and practiſe the good doctrines of theyr Church. Nay, will they ſay that the Prelates (the chief officers and pillars of theyr Church) do ſo embrace them? Not to ſpeak of the many
<pb facs="tcp:177485:6"/>
thouſands of theyr Church, who do not ſo much as know the doctrines of truth retayned and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> them. So far are they from profeſſing and practiſing them in ſyncerity. And yet are they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as the beſt, members of theyr Church: partakers of theyr Sacraments: Miniſters, Governours, copartners, of theyr Worſhip, Aſſemblyes, procedings <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Finally, mynd that the Argument and Replyes following ſpeak of the profeſſion and practiſe of all theyr Aſſemblyes and members thereof, as they ſtand according to Law. <hi>Pag.</hi> 3.6. But here he ſpeaketh onely of ſuch among them, as do in ſimplicity of heart beleev and embrace theyr good doctrines: and therefore neyther of all theyr Aſſemblyes, nor of all the members of them. See then here how inſufficiently they have reaſoned, and how deceitfully they have dealt all this while. Beſides, the queſtion being of a viſible Church, he ſpeaketh onely of ſuch as may belong to the inviſible. Which is not to the poynt in controverſy. For the profeſſion and practiſe according to Law (ſpoken of in the Argument) may be knowen and diſcerned of men: the ſimplicity of the heart (here ſpoken of) God onely kooweth. Thus with wynding in and out, they have loſt both the queſtion: and themſelves too (I feare) if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne not in tyme and with ſimplicity of heart vnto the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The nature and force of theyr corruptions (derived from Antichriſt the deadly enemy of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt) is purpoſely handled in the diſcourſe following, in the 1. 2. 3. 6. 7. and 9. Reaſons. The Apoſtle ſaith, that even<note n="*" place="margin">1. Tim. 4.1.2.3.</note> 
                     <hi>the forbidding of Meats and Mariage, is a departing from the faith.</hi> Mr Beza ſpeaking particularly of the Church of England, and but of fower or five off theyr corruptions, <hi>viz, plurality of benefices, licences of Non-reſidency, licences to marry, and to eat fleſh,</hi> ſaith that<note n="‡" place="margin">Bez. Epiſt. 8</note> 
                     <hi>the Antichriſtian Church hath not any thing more intolerable,</hi> yea that <hi>the retayning of theſe is not a corruption of Chriſtianity, but a manifeſt defection from Chriſt.</hi> Now if fower or five of theyr corruptions: yea if two of them, be a manifeſt departing from the faith of Chriſt: what may we think of theyr whole Hierarchy and multitude of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian abominations retayned among them beſides?</p>
                  <p>Yet this mans conſcience is ſo feared, as he feareth not to ſay though they were thrice as many as they are / yet they are not to the purpoſe for which they are vrged, that is: to convince the Antichriſtian conſtitution of theyr Church, and to warrant ſeparation therefrom. Which is as much as if he ſhould ſay, more plainely, Let the Apoſtels ſay of it what they will: and let Chriſt himſelf commaund vs never ſo ſtraitly to ſeparate from ſuch, and to towch no vnclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne thing at all: (1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.2.3. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17.) Yet it is to no purpoſe, if <hi>D. B.</hi> and <hi>Mr Iacob</hi> with theyr conſorts agree otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>The Anabaptiſticall perfection then, whereof he dreameth, he may well apply to himſelf and his fellowes: who will be perfit and holy in theyr way: if theyr owne faucyes perſwade them ſo: albeit they ſtand in never ſo many knowen errors: and thoſe alſo of Antichriſt: yea and peremptorily condemne all ſuch as partake not in theyr ſinnes: but ſeparate from theyr Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian worſhip and Miniſtery / as Chriſt hath commaunded.</p>
                  <p>The way a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Church, is according to the Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſt. Weakly in deed a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with much imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do we walk therein by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinne that doth ſo compaſſe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cleave faſt vnto vs. Neyther was there ever in the world any Churches or Chriſtians: whoſe caſe was not ſuch. Nor can we ever look for other vpon the earth. Even the Prophets and Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les have thus acknowledged of themſelves. <hi>Eſa</hi> 64.6, 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12.13. and 103.10. <hi>Iob.</hi> 9.30.31. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12 1. <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17.18. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.8.9.10. and 2.1.2. But ſhould we therefore be perſwaded to abide in knowen errors: or to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy ſuch Churches as ſtand in the way and conſtitution of Antichriſt? Common ſence might teach to reaſon otherwiſe, and to diſcerne between things that differ ſo much, as theſe doe, one from another.</p>
                  <p>For our difference of judgement in ſome things, if it were as he ſaith, yet it would no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing availe them. The<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 11. &amp; 15. and 21. Chap. Rom. 14. ch. 1 Cor. 8. and 10. chap. Phil. 3.15.16</note> Chriſtians in the Primitive Churches differed in iudgement amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g themſelves in divers waighty things, ſome concerning Iudaiſme: ſome concerning Paganiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me: <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſynce that tyme:<note n="“" place="margin">See the Acts and Mounuents &amp;c.</note> the Martyrs in Queen Maryes dayes and former ages did in ſundry things (and thoſe of great moment, and concerning Antichriſts religion) differ in judgement one from another. Should theſe therefore have approved and taken part with the Iewiſh, Heathniſh, or Popiſh Churches in theyr other errors: wherein they did joyntly ſee and witneſſe the truth againſt them? Or will he ſay: there was therefore no equity in theyr dealing: becauſe they did it not? Or that they were <hi>ſo vvholy given and bent theyr vvits and mynds ſo much, to look into the eſtate of other men and other Churches, and to apply the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to them: as they ſeldome or never lookt into theyr ovvne eſtate, or applyed the Scriptures to
<pb facs="tcp:177485:6"/>
themſelues?</hi> Yet thus abſurdly and vnconſcionably doth this man reaſon againſt vs. Off which more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Now for the particulars here mentioned: the firſt which is of ſwearing by a book: is an impudent vntruth: ſo far as ever I knew or heard of any among vs. Not onely ſome but all of vs hold it ſimply vnlawfull to ſweare by a book. It is<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 6.13.</note> the Name of the Lord onely, by which all men ought to ſweare. Thus we do all profeſſe and practiſe. In deed about the ceremony of laying the hand vpon the book (thereby to ſignify that we do take the oath) there hath ben queſtion ſome thinking that it might be ſo done, as<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 24.2.3.9.</note> Abrahams ſervant (when he took an oath) put his hand vnder his Maiſters thigh, and perſware vnto him onely by the Lord God of heaven and earth: or as Abraham did himſelf lift vp his hand to the Lord, when he ſware or vowed vnto him as we read: <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.22. Others thinking that becauſe it hath ben ſuperſtitiouſly abuſed: and ſtill may nouriſh in the ignorant the error of ſwearing by the book: that therefore it ſhould not be done. 1. <hi>Theſ</hi> 5.22. And notwithſtanding this difference yet all of vs (for the reaſons laſt alleadged) think it better to be left then retayned ſtill, and ſome other ceremony free from ſuch pollution and daunger (as the lifting vp of the hand to heaven: or ſuch like) to be vſed inſtead thereof.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>probates of vvils, taking of adminiſtration, ſuing &amp;c.</hi> ſome it may be think: that the things themſelves being in theyr nature meerly Civill: and the ordering of them being put over to the Doctors and Profeſſors of the Civill Law: they might thus far be admitted. And this ſo much the rather: becauſe if all the Popiſh Hierarchy and Canons were quite aboliſhed out of the Land (as they ought to be) Yet an order for theſe things notwithſtanding were ſtill to be had, and ſuch as are ſkilfull in the Civill Law might be employed thereyn: aſwell as any other of the Common wealth: being by the Prince and Magiſtrae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s appoynted therevnto. Others thinking / that inaſmuch as theſe cauſes / Courts / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Officers are now in theyr eſtate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Prelates (whoſe functions are meerly Antichriſtian) that therefore they ſhould not be admitted at all. Yet here agayne / all of vs agree in this / that the whole Hierarchy with whatſoever belongeth thereto, is wholy to be abandoned and refuſed, and no ſpirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to be had therewith at all.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>ſhutting vp of ſhops on Holy dayes and Feſtivall dayes &amp;c.</hi> (as he doth Popiſhly terme them): What if ſome think / that our bodyes / goods / and lands: being ſubiect in the Lord (as they ought) to the Magiſtrates, that therefore they may at theyr appointment then ſhift by theyr ſhops, as they do on the Queens day or ſuch like ſolemnityes? And others think, that foraſmuch as theyr Holydayes both are popiſh dayes and popiſhly vſed for theyr divine worſhip that therefore they ſhould not ſhut vp theyr ſhops on theſe dayes more then any other. Yet all agree in this, that theſe dayes (though the Prince commaund it never ſo ſtraily) are no more to be ſet apart or vſed for publik worſhip, then any other of the ſir week-dayes: Alſo, that they need not leave theyr work any more on thoſe dayes, then any other whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the particulars he nameth. If he could have mentioned any other of greater moment, you may be ſure they ſhould not have ben omitted. Let him know then, that we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o and ought to account it among the mercyes of God towards vs that our difference in jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement is but ſuch: ſpecially conſidering, that there is ſo great a moſtery of iniquity in the religion of Antichriſt, throughout al the parts thereof, as (iff it were poſſible) the very elect ſhould be deceived: that we are as it were but newly and as per weakly come out of that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Babylon: that the particulars here obiected were never publikly debated and diſenſſed among vs: that as the Primitive Churches, ſo ours have ben exerciſed not onely with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other queſtions and controverſyes but with ſundry perverſe, hypocriticall, contentious, and fantaſticall ſpirits which have much troubled vs and cauſed the truth to be evill ſpoken of: they cree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beſides, that even by this meanes, we might learne to beare one with another: and if any will yet be contentious, that they might know we have no ſuch cuſtome, nor the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God.</p>
                  <p>The vſe then that we are to make of ſuch difference of judgement, is not that we ſhould therefore abide in knowen errors our ſelves or approve knowen evill in others, or joyne with any falſe worſhip and Miniſtery in the ſervice of God, or refuſe any truth revealed vnto vs
<pb facs="tcp:177485:7"/>
(wherein we do all agree in one): but that being delivered out of the power of darknes, which is in the Kingdome of Sathan and Antichriſt, we ſhould walk together as children of the light / holding forth the truth wherevnto we are come, joyntly and faithfully, agaynſt all adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes thereof, and wayting with pacyence till God reveale further for the more vniting of our mynds wherein any ſhall yet differ one from another. And this doth the Scripture teach a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d warrant vnto vs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5.6.</p>
                  <p>But now if any erring in theyr judgement, do not ſo reſt in peace, but will needs proceed further to ſpread theyr difference among the brethren, to vrge and purſue the practiſe thereoff, to diſquyet the reſt that are contrary mynded, to refuſe communion with the Church vnles they would ioyne or conſent vnto them therein: then are ſuch being firſt convinced and remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning obſtinate, to be further proceded withall by the Church, as the caſe and theyr cariage ſhall requier. And that ſo, as if any be found but to be contentious, they are euen therefore to be reproved, and (if they ceaſe not) to be caſt out and removed from the Church: For which ſee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Math.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.13-18. Thus we are perſwaded, and thus we walk and practiſe.</p>
                  <p>Now let the Reader iudge, how frivolous this his obiection is: ſeing there may be ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things wherein the brethren of the ſame Church may differ in iudgement among themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, and yet notwithſtanding walk togeather in the ſame faith / teſtimony / and fellowſhip, wherein God hath vnited theyr mynds: none of them being contentious, to diſquyet the Church or the members thereof: and all being ready to receyve the truth, which God by his word ſhall further make knowen, whatſoever it be. And this I dare boldly ſay, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall not thus hold and walk, they ſhall not onely condemne the Apoſtles, and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches / together with the Martyrs (whoſe examples I alledged before): but ſhall fynd by experience that neyther any Churches, neyther ſo much as two or three men, ſhall ever be able to keep fellowſhip any while together among themſelves. Note alſo, that when ſuch pleaſe themſelves moſt in theyr contentions and confuſions: thinking they do God ſervice the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein / even then they do moſt diſpleaſe him, who is the God not of confuſion / but of peace / as we ſee in all the Churches of the Saints. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33.</p>
                  <p>This I thought needfull to write (being thus occaſioned) concerning this poynt. I could alſo put him in mynd of the manifold and vnreconciliable difference of iudgement which is in theyr Church and the members thereof, between the Prelates, Reformiſts, Newters and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo-dexters / with the like. But I will not ſtand vpon it. Mynd but here what Mr Iacob profeſſeth openly in the Treatiſe following,<note place="margin">Pag. 69.</note> viz. <hi>that the things vvhich the State of theyr Church holdeth to be Chriſts ovvne, he holdeth to be Antichriſts.</hi> Then which what can be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? Will they now therefore affoard that favour to the Papiſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Anabaptiſts / and other Antichriſtians / which they would ſhould be affoarded to themſelves, namely: That as they would be accounted true Chriſtians / through theyr faith in Chriſt / notwithſtanding theyr errours (which they muſt acknowledge are infinite many / euen in theyr Church-conſtitution / ſo they ſhould account of the aforeſaid Antichriſts and others in the like caſe? Or will he now ſay / <hi>that euen common ſence and humanity vvould requier them to graunt this?</hi> When he is at leyſure to write ſuch an other Preface in defence of Mr Iacob and himſelf / as he hath done this in defence of theyr Churches / then it will be tyme ynough to impreſſe this thing a litle better in theyr mynds. In the meane tyme / this may ſuffice to ſhew how ſenceles and vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable theyr reaſoning and dealing is.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>the marks of the Beaſt</hi> (ſpoken of <hi>Reu.</hi> 14.) we vnderſtand: the defection and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the man of ſinne / ſpoken of 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3-12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.2.3.

                  <p>Here I will onely annexe the teſtimony of one of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> a good while ſynce / when An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt as yet was but a litle diſcovered: in reſpect as ſynce that tyme he hath ben. One of the Articles againſt <hi>Iohn Claydon,</hi> who was burned at London in Smithfield: in the yeare 1415 was this, <hi>That the Biſſhops licence for a man to preach the vvord of God, is the true character of the Beaſt, that is Antichriſt.</hi> Where marke / that albeit a man preach the word of God / yet he ſayth <hi>the Biſhops licence</hi> ſo to do / is the Beaſts marke. <hi>Act. and Monum. edit.</hi> 5. <hi>Pag.</hi> 588. <hi>b.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much I thought to write here alſo concerning this poynt. Yet if D. B. or Mr Iacob for him (who do both of them receyve and carry daily the Beaſts marks in theyr fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads and hands, and therefore may well have ſure knowledge thereof) can ſhew them any better from the word of God, I ſhall willingly heare it. And ſeing that here he wiſheth we knew the marks of the Beaſt a litle better / we do alſo entreat him (if his leaſure and ability will ſerve) to make them a litle better knowen vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>But I doubt, it will now be found in him and the reſt of them at this day: as Mr Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley (that faithfull Martyr) found and complayned in his tyme: ſaying, I feare me (nay it is certayne) the World that wanteth the light of the Spirit of God (for the world is not able to receyve him / ſayth Iohn) neyther doth nor ſhall know the Beaſt, nor his marks, though he rage cruelly and live never ſo beaſtly, and though his marked men be in number like the ſand of the ſea. <hi>Act. and Mon.</hi> 5. <hi>edit.

                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude this matter then / may I not well returne <hi>theyr ovvne ſpeach</hi> vpon themſelves and ſay, Surely they are (for the moſt part) ſo wholy given, and bend their wits and mynds ſo much: to look into the eſtate of other men and other Churches: and to apply the Scriptures to them: as they ſeldome or never look into their owne eſtate, or apply the Scriptures to themſelues. But let them look vnto it, it will be theyr decay in the end.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>all errors are alike</hi> is a fancy of his owne. We did neuer imagine it. We know and profeſſe otherwiſe. To give but one inſtance, The Iewes, the Arrians, the Papiſts, the Mungrell-proteſtants, the Lutherans, the Anabaptiſts <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do all of them at this day erre very greatly concerning the Perſon or Office of Ieſus Chriſt, who is<note n="“" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.11.</note> the onely foundation of the Church. Yet we know, theyr errors are not all alike. Some are greater, ſome leſſer: ſome in one poynt, ſome in another. But this we ſay, that all theyr errors are ſuch, as every faithfull Chriſtian ought to eſchew them, and to witnes the contrary truth againſt them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, as they will aunſwer to God at that day.</p>
                  <p>His obiection likewiſe of <hi>all the commaundements of God to be obeyed alike &amp;c.</hi> is of his owne coyning. I do not think that ever he heard it of any of vs, or that he did ever ſee it in any of our writings. If he did, he may ſhew it. We know / that Chriſt ſpeaking of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of the firſt Table: ſayth: This is firſt and the great commaundement. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.39. And that therefore the du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>es of the ſecond table muſt alway give place to the firſt / as to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (<hi>Math.</hi> 10.37.39. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.24.)

We acknowledge alſo there is difference in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of the firſt Table, when they are compared together one with another. And in the commaundements likewiſe of the <hi>Second.</hi> And conſequently therefore in the dutyes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in both: for our obedience. Theſe things are ſo well knowen, as they may learne them of very children.</p>
                  <p>Note withall, that we are bound to keep not onely the greateſt of the commaundements of God, but even the very leaſt (notwithſtanding any perſwaſion / prohibition / or perſecution to the contrary) becauſe they are all from one and the ſame God: with commaundement to obey them all and every one: and that vnder payne of damnation. Therefore alſo Chriſt ſayd / The Second is like to the firſt and great commaundement / <hi>Math.</hi> 22.39. Now iff any in this ſence do ſay that <hi>all the Scriptures and commaundements of God are fundamentall and to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed alike,</hi> it may well be vnderſtood according to that ſaying of our Lord Ieſus before alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.38.39.40. Otherwiſe there is difference to be put (as is aforeſaid) in the dutyes both of the two Tables themſelves / and of the ſeverall commaundements of each of them.</p>
                  <p>His inſerting of theſe two words / the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>fundamentall</hi> (when he ſaith, <hi>that all the Scriptures and commaundements of God are fundamentall and to be obeyed alike</hi>) I will not now further ſtand vpon. It ſeemeth he did it for ſome evaſion: Which I doubt not but
<pb facs="tcp:177485:8"/>
his next Reply (if he be not already at a <hi>Non plus</hi>) will make more manifeſt. Till then / let this ſuffice which hath ben ſaid.</p>
                  <p>The place of (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12.15.) both he and Mr Iacob do miſvnderſtand and miſalledge. The Apoſtel ſpeaketh not there / of any falſe doctrine or errors built vppon the foundation / but of the entiſing ſpeach of mans wiſdome and vayne eloquence off words. By which it came to paſſe / that although they taught nothing but the truth and ſo buylt vpon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation Ieſus Chriſt / yet they did it vnworthily / and not as became the ſimplicity of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt. That this is the true and playne meaning of the Apoſtles ſpeach / appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thus:</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. &amp; 3 chap.</note>1. Firſt / by comparing together the ſecond and third chapters of this Epiſtle: Where all may ſee / that he ſpeaketh not a worde of any error or vntruth that was taught, but of the ſimplicity (on the one hand) and of the oſtentation of ſpeach and humane wiſdome (on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) which was vſed by the Teachers of Corinth in theyr building vpon the foundation / that is / in theyr teaching of the truth of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly / for that the very terme<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.10.</note> here vſed by the Apoſtle / concerneth directly the <hi>maner</hi> of teaching or building vpon the foundation / not the <hi>matter</hi> taught or built vpon it. His words are theſe: <hi>Let euery man take heed</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>vvhat,</hi> for the matter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly / becauſe for the matter taught / the Apoſtle doth els where give another rule concerning all teachers of errors and falſe doctrine (though they ſhould be Angels from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) <hi>viz.</hi> to give them no countenance at all / neyther to have any communion with them / but to ſeparate from them / and hold them accurſed. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6 3.4.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17.18: 2 <hi>Ioh ver.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18.19. Note alſo / that of the teachers ſpoken of to the Corinthians / the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith <hi>themſelues ſhalbe ſaved:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.15.</note> albeit <hi>theyr vvork</hi> (of affected eloquence) <hi>do burne</hi> and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh away as ſmoke: Whereas contrarily of the teachers of erroneous doctrine he ſaith, They <hi>haue not God: neither ſerve the Lord Ieſus: but are accurſed.</hi> For proof whereof / ſee the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res here alleadged before.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Finally / becauſe the Apoſtle writing els where to the ſame purpoſe and to the ſame Church of Corinth / doth himſelf playnely declare that this is his meaning: As namely in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.13.17.19.20.21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.3.4.5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6 For which cauſe it may well be thought / that the Spirit of God in this place did in great wiſdome and of purpoſe compare theyr entiſing ſpeach and vayne eloquence / to <hi>vvood: hay: and ſtubble:</hi> which are combuſtible a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cannot abide the tryall of fier: that whereas they did much glory in this courſe / they might euen by this reſemblance now ſee and conſider the vanity thereof / and how vnworthy it was to be ſuted with the foundation / which is Ieſus Chriſt. As on the contrary / he reſembleth the teaching of the Goſpell in ſimplicity and playne evidence of the Spirit / to <hi>gold and ſilver</hi> / which will abide the fier / and to <hi>precious ſtones</hi> which are of great valew: to teach them by this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon / that albeit ſuch maner of teaching ſeemed baſe in outward ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>Thus much I thought to write here / for the clearing of the true ſence and meaning of this Scripture. Which by reaſon of miſunderſtanding / is perverted not onely by the Papiſts to mainteyne theyr feyned Purgatory: but by many Proteſtants alſo / partly to vphold ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors annd doctrines as they hold againſt the word of God / partly to defend theyr eſtate / not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that ſuch errors and falſe doctrines be retayned among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now by this which hath ben ſaid / the Reader may ſee / both how ignorantly this Scripture is miſapplyed by Mr Iacob and his Scribe: and that being diſappoynted hereof / they have not ſo much as the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of any one Scripture to alledge in defence of theyr Church-eſtate. But it comes well to paſſe (as<note n="*" place="margin">Beza in 1 Cor. 3.10.</note> one ſayth of Purgatory-fyer) that theyr <hi>Church conſtitution</hi> is built of ſtubble wood and hay / ſo as the flame of God being now kindled agayne / there is no marvell that in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory it is for the moſt part already ſet on fyer.</p>

May it not fitly be ſaid and applyed to <hi>D.

Hypocrite / firſt caſt the beame out of thyne owne eye / and then ſhalt thou ſee clearly to caſt the mote out of thy brothers eye. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.4.5.

And now agayne for thoſe Scriptures which here in his Third note he ſetteth downe eyther as alledged by vs / or noted by himſelf out of the Evangeliſts for defence of theyr eſtate: what other thing doth he in aunſwer of the one / or allegation of the other / but onely pervert a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d miſapply them / againſt the true ſence and purpoſe of the Spirit of God therein?

                  <p>Firſt then note / that there are three things ſpecially for which we alledge theſe and many other Scriptures which he concealeth. Namely / 1. That in the conſtitution of every true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church / even from the beginning of the world / this hath alway ben one ſpeciall thing to be obſerved / that it was ſeparated from the world and abominations thereof. Neyther other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe could there ever be any true viſible Church vpon the earth. And yet with the Church of England it is not thus / in theyr eſtate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Church of England now ſtanding in confuſion with the world / and ſubiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Antichriſts Miniſtery / worſhip <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we therefore (as all other the people of God) are bound to ſeparate and depart from it / becauſe otherwiſe we could not but partake in her ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes / and ſo be ſubiect alſo to receyve of her plagues.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That being thus ſeparated from them / we are bound to ioyne to the true Church of Chriſt in the communion of his Goſpell / to keep all his ordinances / whatſoever he hath in his word preſcribed for his Church / notwithſtanding any perſecution or exception of Man to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three things are ſo evidently and vndeniably taught in theſe and the like Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res throughout the book of God / as it is ſtraunge and lamentable that any having them thus applyed / ſhould yet be ſo piteouſly blynd as not to ſee it / or ſo impudently bold as to deny it, For other the like Scriptures therefore / teaching the ſame things / ſee theſe alſo / <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.1.4.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.12-16. <hi>et</hi> 35.2.3. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.22.23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.25.26.27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.8.9.24.25.26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.5.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.4.5.6. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.3.5.6.11. <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.30. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 119.21.113.128. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 2.2.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.12-18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 44.5. <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.18 <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.12.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 50.4.5.8. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16.44. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.26. <hi>Micah.</hi> 2.10 <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.21.22.23. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6.7.8.12.13.14. <hi>ct</hi> 2.8.9.13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.16.17.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.1 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41.47. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.29. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.26.27.28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.4.7.34. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17.18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6.7. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.5.27.28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.2. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8.22.23. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.3-12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3.4.5.13.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1.2.3.13.14.15. 2 <hi>Ioh. ver.</hi> 9.10.11. <hi>Iude, ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.9.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.

9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.4.6. and 21.7.8.27. and 22.10-19. The words of theſe and the like Scriptures / I need not here ſet downe. The godly Reader will ſearch them (I doubt not) after the example of the Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Next I aunſwer / that the Apoſtles do themſelues ſo alledge and apply the Scriptures to the matters which they handle / as we after theyr example do in this. For proof hereof / ſee but theſe places following, and mynd them well, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. and 9.9.10. and 10.7-18 and 14.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.25.26.27, 28.29. and 10.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2, 13.14. and 3.7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 12.26 29. and 13.2.5.6. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.8.9.10.21.22.23. and 4.5.6. and 5.16.17.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. and 2. <hi>to</hi> and 3.20.21. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.

Now compare herewith the places in the old Teſtament from whence theſe are borrowed / and you ſhall fynd that divers differences might be noted between the one and the other. Shall we therefore ſay / that they are wreſted or miſapplyed by the Apoſtles? God forbid. To give an inſtance or two. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Paul alledgeth that againſt fornication / which by Moſes was firſt ſpoken of lawfull mariage / 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>compared vvith Gen.</hi> 2.24. And in the ſame Epiſtle / albeit the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians which were of the Church there / did not worſhip God by the Idols of Corinth / but did onely eat at the feaſts in the Temple / which were after the ſacrifices done: yet the Apoſtle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth agaynſt them the example of the Iſraelites, who both made a golden calfe / and by it worſhipped the Lord. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. and 10. <hi>chap. vvith Exod.</hi> 32.5.6. And the Apoſtle Iames / ſpeaking but of one particular breach of the Law / <hi>viz,</hi> the accepting of mens perſons / alledgeth and applyeth againſt it, the ſumme of the whole Second Table. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.8.9.10 <hi>vvith Let.</hi> 19.18. And Iude / agaynſt Apoſtates / Schiſmatiks / diſbounders of themſelues / raylers / murmurers / malicious / covetous / preſumptuous / laſcivious / hypocriticall / vnſtable / diſcontended / and ſuch like perſons / alledgeth the Prophecyes / Scriptures / examples / which were before / of them in Enochs tyme / of the vnbeleuing Iewes / the Sodomites / evill Angels / Cain / Balaam / Corah / <hi>&amp;c.

Yet are they all notwithſtanding / fit and pertinent for that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they apply them. Neyther can any be ignorant / but that there will be difference eyther of time / place / cauſe / ſexte / perſons / things / maner / or ſuch like circumſtance / in any allegations / and yet they be pertinent nevertheles.</p>
                  <p>It is not materiall then / though ſome differences might be noted between the caſe of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land / and theyrs of whom thoſe Scriptures ſpeak: ſeing notwithſtanding they do fitly prove that / for which they are alledged. Let the Reader alſo mynd here / an old Popiſh ſhift / whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby they labour to turne away the evidence of any Scripture that is vrged againſt theyr cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions / <hi>viz,</hi> by noting ſome difference between theyr caſe and ſuch as the Scriptures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged ſpeak of. This you may ſee every where in theyr Rhemiſh notes on the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment / and in all the reſt of theyr books and defence of theyr Church and religion.</p>
                  <p>But now further / to make the abuſe of his lips yet the more manifeſt, marke that the very Scriptures here mentioned by himſelf / ſpeak not onely / <hi>of the vvhole body and povver of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Antichriſtian religion</hi> (as he pretendeth) but of every particular ordinance and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane thing belonging therevnto. For thus they ſpeak expreſſely. <hi>Tovvch</hi> no <hi>vncleane thing: Keep all myne ordinances and all my iudgements: Be ye cleane: Partake not in her ſinnes, &amp;c.</hi> By all which is moſt plainely forbidden all maner of partaking not of the whole onely / but of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parcell of Antichriſts or any other falſe worſhip whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond difference which he noteth here / of <hi>theyr vvilfulnes: rebellion: obſtinacy: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking vvith the lavvfull and good things vſed among them &amp;c.</hi> it is handled and anſwered in the Treatiſe following. <hi>Pag.</hi> 42. 43. 88. 108. 130. 132 161. 170. 171. 175. 180.</p>
                  <p>The particulars which he citeth out of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> towching the Iewes / are the ſpeaches and teſtimony of reproof / given vnto them by Chriſt / whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now he threatned to take away from them his kingdome / becauſe of thoſe ſinnes and other the like among them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.43.

Novv, if the chief offices, vvere ſo corrupted and altered through couetouſnes, as the Hiſtories make mention: It is not likely, that the inferior offices did remaine ſound, but vvere aſmuch or more altered: The Prieſts (generally) being ſuch couetous vvicked perſons, theyr offices beeing very gainefull: and beſides they liuing vnder the authoritie of the Heathiriſh Romans, vvho ruled ouer them.

and ſeparate from them, for much falſe doctrine publikly taught and mainteyned among them: and for theyr wretched perſecution of the truth and Martyrs of Ieſus. (Therefore do we not wholy depend on theyr outward conſtitution: From which (it is to be noted, that) he ſevereth theyr publik doctrine, as himſelf ſheweth in the next Section: and ſo therefore here we ſpeak accordingly.) And that he knoweth theſe things / appeareth both by this Treatiſe firſt publiſhed by himſelf, where we have declared it in divers particulars (<hi>Pag.</hi> 66. 108. 157. 158 159. 160.) and in that himſelf hath ſeen and alleadgeth in this very Section / another treatiſe, written in anſwer of Mr <hi>A.

                  <p>To the holy Ghoſt he giveth the lye / yea and maketh Chriſt our Lord a ſinner, in that which here he ſpeaketh firſt of <hi>the conſtitution of the Ievviſh Churches.</hi> For the Scripture teacheth that the conſtitution of that Church was a true one / and that Chriſt did himſelf / communicate therein with them. Yet this man beſides that he ſayth afterward, <hi>that it is very likely the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and outvvard conſtitution thereof vvere vvholy altered from the right inſtitution:</hi> Euen here at firſt he ſayth peremptorily, <hi>that it vvas as greatly altered and corrupted, as is the conſtitution of the Churches of England.</hi> Which how ſhamefully falſe it is / may appeare even by this / that in thoſe very tymes the eſtate of the Iewes Church yet was ſuch as they were a people ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the world / having the true Miniſtery / ordinances / worſhip / and adminiſtration / which God by Moſes had commanded: As theſe Scriptures do plainely teſtify / <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.6.8 9.10 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.22.23.24.27.46. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.55.2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3.5. Yea they would not at any hand admit eyther of confuſion of people or of any other Miniſtery then God had ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: As may be ſeen / for the firſt / in <hi>Act.</hi> 21.28 29. and for the latter, in <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.19-25. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.25.26. How ſhameles then is it to ſay as here he doth, that theyr conſtitution was as greatly altered and corrupted as that of the Churches of England, which to this day ſtand confuſed of all ſorts of people (aſwell the prophaneſt as the beſt among them) and have no other Miniſtery or Leiturgy, but ſuch as they have receyved from Antichriſt the man of ſinne, and from Babylon that mother of whoredomes and abominations of the earth? <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.5.</p>
                  <p>And further, if the Iewiſh Church had ben thus corrupted (as he feareth not to affirme) how could Chriſt have communicated with them as he did, but he muſt needs have ſinned a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that highly againſt the Law of God: <hi>viz.</hi> if he had (as it is now in England) joyned to ſuch a Church as were vnſeparated from the World: or had partaken with a falſe Miniſtery: or had ſent others to a ſtraunge Prieſthood and Service: or had approved by word or deed any other ordinances then thoſe which God had commaunded <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Scribe then muſt eyther approve the Church-conſtitution of England by the word of God: or els confeſſe that it and the Iewiſh Churches are in this poynt nothing alike, or (if neyther of theſe) that then Ieſus Chriſt was a ſinner: Of whom the truth itſelf and work of our redemption teſtify / that he knew no ſinne at all, but was like to vs in all things / ſinne excepted. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.26. This man then doth thus alſo both blaſpheme the Sonne of God / and make the holy Ghoſt a lyar.</p>
                  <p>But there were (he ſaith) <hi>tvvo high Prieſts at once, vvhereas by the Lavv of God there ſhould be but one.</hi> 1. If it were ſo, albeit thus they offended in the number yet ſtill there was that office and function of Prieſthood which God had ordeyned / not a new one of mans deviſe as is the whole Hierarchy of England / from the hyeſt Archbiſhop to the loweſt Pariſh Prieſt. And ſo there is no compariſon between theſe two.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This was the perſonall ſinne of the men / not the conſtitution of that Church / neyther of the Offices wherein they were. See it in another example: Iudas an Apoſtle of Chriſt / yet betrayeth him. Doth it therefore follow / that his office of Miniſtery wherein he was ſet by Chriſt himſelf / was vnlawfull? Nay / that was the ſinne of the Man not of the Office whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein he was. What is this then to the queſtion in hand / when as the Miniſtery of England is charged to be ſtraunge / vnlawfull / falſe / in the very offices and functions thereof? Yea and this man himſelf doth here by the whole courſe of his ſpeach graunt as much.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Is there any thing here ſaid for the Prieſts and conſtitution of the Church of England / which the moſt popiſh Prieſts / Prelates / Monks / <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may not aſwell alledge for theyrs? Is theyr Miniſtery or conſtitution therefore ſuch as man be ioyned withall?</p>

For indeed by them we fynd (euen in the corrupteſt tymes) but one at once to be by Prieſt: Albeit that of old alſo there were two which were chief over all the reſt, the one being principall / the other Second.

                  <p n="6">6.

                  <p>Next where he ſaith, <hi>If the chief offices vvere ſo corrupted and altered through covetouſnes, it is not likely that the inferior offices remayned ſound &amp;c.</hi> And, <hi>It is very likely that the offices, &amp; outvvard conſtitution vvere vvholy altered from the right inſtitution &amp;c.</hi> Firſt I wiſh the Reader to mynd his maner of reaſoning.

A falſe and corrupt outward conſtitution: 2. Or falſe and corrupt doctrines. I thinke they vvill ſay, the corrupt and falſe doctrines are the

greater, as they are indeed: For that they doe vvound, feſter and corrupt the very conſcience, and doe deceive the hearers thereof, Whereas the errors in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of a Church, (eſpecially in ſome circumſtances (as the errors with vs are) and thoſe of no ſmall controverſie, in matters alſo not fundamentall) are nothing nere ſo hurtfull: by hovve much the Tithing of Mint Annis, &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, are of leſſer force then the other vveightier matters of the lavv.

                              <p>If the greater ſinnes (namely in doctrine) doe not ſimply ouerthrovv a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of Chriſtians, from being a true Church: Then much leſſe vvill the leſſer ſinnes (namely in the outvvard conſtitution, &amp;c)</p>

And thus their Obiection of the Iewiſh conſtitution, is (I truſt) fully anſvvered: So that ſtill their peremptory ſeparation and condempning of the Churches of England, for ſome outvvard corruptions, remayneth ſtill a grievous ſinne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their heads for vvhich (vvithout harty repentance) they ſhall one day aunſvver before God, vvhich vvill be too heavie a burthen for them to beare.</p>

That which Chriſt ſayd to the Scribes and Phariſees / <hi>VVo be to you blynd guydes vvhich ſay, VVhoſoever ſvveareth by the Temple, it is nothing: but vvhoſoever ſvveareth by the gold off the Temple,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 23.16.17.</note> 
                     <hi>he offendeth. Ye fooles and blynd, vvhether is greater, the gold, or the Temple that ſanctifyeth the gold, &amp;c.</hi> May it not in this caſe alſo fitly be applyed to this Scribe? Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially / ſeing the Church in the conſtitution thereof (if we ſever it from the doctrine, as here he doth) may in divers reſpects be compared with the Temple / and the doctrine of truth taught and vpheld in the Church, with the gold of the Temple: As both by theſe Scriptures doth plainely appeare (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16.17. <hi>vvith.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.5.6.19.23.24.25.33. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4.4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1.2.) And by this alſo, that God hath made the promiſe of his preſence and bleſſing to his Church (as to the Temple wherein he will dwell) it being ſo conſtituted, and walking / as he hath commaunded. <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.11.12. with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16.17.18. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 52.11.12. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 37.26.27.28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 48.35. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. Yea and this man himſelf did<note n="*" place="margin">Section 3.</note> here a litle before alledge, that by <hi>gold and ſiluer</hi> (ſpoken of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12.) the Apoſtle meaneth true doctrine. Which if it were ſo there / then by his owne expoſition may that ſaying of Chriſt to the Phariſees / well be applyed to him in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I aſke / Doth not <hi>the conſtitution</hi> (be it true or falſe) alway include the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Church, whereas <hi>the falſe Doctrine</hi> is often found but in ſome members thereof? This may be ſeen in the Churches of Iſrael / Corinth, Galatia / Pergamus / etc. In which reſpect alſo the falſe and corrupt conſtitution may be of greater waight and more danger / then the falſe and corrupt <hi>Doctrine:</hi> inaſmuch as the wounding and infecting of the whole body is far worſe then of ſome parts onely: and becauſe the parts ſo infected, if they cannot otherwiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden / may be cut of / and yet the body preſerved: Not contrarily. For the better expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof / let him reſolve me which of theſe propoſitions is the truer, <hi>viz. VVhere there
<pb facs="tcp:177485:12"/>
is in a Church falſe doctrine, there is a falſe Church:</hi> Or this, <hi>VVhere there is a falſe conſtitution there is a falſe Church.</hi> And contrarily.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly I aſke / Is not the Hierarchy and Church conſtitution of Antichriſt / the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable anarchy of Sathan that ever was? And doth not Sathan far more commonly and readily part with his falſe doctrine / then with it / when he muſt needs part with the one,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.9.</note> and yet can retayne the other? He is ſubtill and of long experience / he can mynd and knoweth full well that ſo long as he holdeth his owne conſtitution of a Church / he can quickly (vppon any opportunity) bring in his doctrine agayne / even with a trice. For why? He hath both the people ready for the receyving of it / being yet ſtill in the confuſion and bondage of Antichriſt: and his owne Miniſtery alſo to be imployed in the publiſhing and ſerving thereof: theyr Offices / Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings / Miniſtrations / Maintenance / being all ready at hand and fit for the purpoſe. Whereas on the contrary / when the falſe conſtitution is aboliſhed / then falſe doctrine wanteth both hee woonted place of receipt, and her nimble wings by which ſhe ſhould ſpread and fly abroad. And here I could alledge for proof hereof / the prefer Miniſtery and eſtate of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, which being of Antichriſt Sathans graundchild / and he now having ſpyed his tyme / and found ſome opportunity / beginneth apace by this meanes to bring in agayne ſuch doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his / as had for a tyme ben ſuppreſſed: As namely / <hi>Free-vvill, Auricular Confeſſion, Chriſts ſoule to deſcend into Hell: The Church of Rome to be a true Church, &amp;c.</hi> Witneſſe the Books and publik Sermons of <hi>Bilſon: Bancroft: Hooker: Androes: Harſenet: Barret:</hi> and other the Prieſts and Prelates of that Church / the Marchants of theſe and the like wares off the Beaſt / in Court / City / Countrey / Vniverſity / and where not?</p>
                  <p>The ſame thing you may mynd alſo thus / So long as the houſe ſtandeth ſtill / and is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſervants and Miniſters / it is ready for the implements and furniture (though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved for a tyme) to be brought in agayne / and ſoone to be ſet vp in theyr woonted place. And if you would ſee an example of theſe things yet in memory / look but at the Churches eſtate in K. Edwards and Q. Maryes dayes compared together. The popiſh conſtitution of the Church being not aboliſhed in King Edwards tyme / how ſoone was the Popes doctrine / yea and his ſupremacy / in Queen Maryes dayes ſpread and acknowledged throughout the Land? Yet the ſame doctrines of truth were in K. Edwards tyme publiſhed and receyved / which now are in England. And very like alſo that it was then with more zeale and love of the truth / the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now it is: ſpecially conſidering the generall coldnes of men / and the cruell perſecution of the truth / to which this age ſynce is come.</p>
                  <p>Mynd further / that the Offices / houſes, and maintenance of the Fryers and Nunnes being before (in the time of K. Henry the eight) quite taken away / they were not able in all Q. Maryes raigns to reare them vp agayne. No, albeit they iudged them lawfull and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary aſwell as the other poynts of Popery / and did alſo very earneſtly deſier and labour to have them reeſtabliſhed. So great a matter it is to have a thing aboliſhed in the whole conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution thereof: Even as when an houſe is raſed and pulled downe to the very foundation.</p>
                  <p>And here / vpon this occaſion let me alſo aſke, Whether if the Callings and Livings of the Prelates and Prieſts / together with the Idoll Temples / and confuſion of all maner people in the body of the Church / now had in England / were ſo dealt with / as the Abbats / Monks / Abbeyes and Nunryes then were: there would not fewer Ieſuites and Seminaryes come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Land: Popery leſſe increaſe: treaſon againſt her Maieſty be leſſe attempted: and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally / all the meanes and hope for the full replanting of Antithriſts religion agayne in that Church / be vtterly removed and taken away?</p>
                  <p>Let this Scribe then go and perſwade ſuch as himſelf / that the outward conſtitution of the Church is but as <hi>the tithing of Mynt: Anniſe, and Commin, &amp;c.</hi> Whoſoever have theyr <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> exerciſed to diſcerne good and evill / will playnely ſee / that notwithſtanding any thing he pretendeth / yet it is and ought to be accounted among the waighty matters of the Law of God. Yea, that it is of far other importance and conſequence, then moſt men think or will yet be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded: albeit even experience (the Miſtreſſe of fooles) might in all this tyme and tryall have taught them ſufficient / if ynough were ynough for men / In caſes of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Now for <hi>his Reaſon</hi> here / any may ſee by that which hath ben ſayd that it is very frivolous and of no waight at all. The Propoſition (or firſt part) hath nothing for the ground of it, but that which is in queſtion, and neyther is alway true nor can be yeelded vnto for very great and waighty cauſes here before declared. Vnto which adde theſe alſo: 1. That many errors in doctrine are and may be far leſſe / then the errors of the outward conſtitution / when they are truly compared together. 2. That the true outward conſtitution of the Church alway im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth
<pb facs="tcp:177485:13"/>
both a ſeparation of the people from the World / and the joyning of them together in the fellowſhip of the Goſpell / and both theſe to be voluntary. Which particulars being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with the former / will teach him not barely to ſet downe / but duly to prove the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his next Reply.</p>
                  <p>The Aſſumption (or ſecond part of the Reaſon) is in ſome fence true, in ſome ſence falſe: and in both, againſt himſelf and their Churches eſtate. When Churches are ſet in the conſtitution and way of Chriſt / if afterward they fall into ſome errour of doctrine / they are notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding for the former to be reputed true Churches, vntill being admoniſhed they refuſe to heare the voyce of Chriſt and to yeeld to the truth. Thus the Aſſumption is true / and of vs confeſſed, by the example of the Churches of the Iewes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when theyr caſe cometh to be ſuch, as they will rather abide in errour then obey the truth and voyce of Chriſt / this ſo wilfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting ſimply overthroweth ſuch a company from being a true Church in ſuch eſtate. And thus the Aſſumption is falſe / and ſo proved to be / by the example of the ſaid Churches. And both wayes it is agaynſt him and theyr Church: as will yet further appeare by that which is now to be ſpoken of his queſtion wherein he would be reſolved.</p>
                  <p>He aſketh, <hi>VVhat if a company of Arrians, Anabaptiſts, or Papiſts ſhould be gathered and eſtabliſhed in a true outvvard conſtitution, and ſtill retayne theyr fundamentall errors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named: VVhether then their outvvard conſtitution ſhould make them a true Church, Yea or no.</hi> I aunſwer / 1. Not onely falſe conſtitution / but falſe doctrine alſo retayned, make a falſe Church. If it were ſo then / that they could have a true conſtitution as he ſuppoſeth / yet by reaſon of theyr falſe doctrine they ſhould be a falſe Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 I aſke alſo of him / Whether theſe companyes of whom he ſpeaketh / were true Churches when they fell into thoſe errors (as were the Churches of Galatia / when the errors about Circumciſion and the Law crept in among them): Or whether they were Hereticks, Sectaryes or the like (ſuch as were Hymeneus, Philetus, Alexander, the Apoſtates of Rome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) falling from the true faith and Churches of God, when they came to be gathered and eſtabliſhed as he fancyeth. If they were of the former ſort, then they are to be eſtemed and admoniſhed as true Churches, till by deſpiſing the voyce of Chriſt / the Kingdome of God be taken from among them <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>vvith.</hi> 5.2.4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.33.43. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>vvith</hi> 15.12. <hi>Rev</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> If of the latter then are they no true Churches at all but falſe and deteſtable Synagogues of Sathan whatſoever truth in conſtitution or otherwiſe they ſhall pretend. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.9, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.30. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8.23. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3.7. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19.20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.20.21. <hi>and</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17.18. <hi>and</hi> 3.5.6.13. <hi>and.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38.39. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.2.3. <hi>In de. ver.</hi> 18.19. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18, <hi>chap.</hi>

Of all other things it is moſt like he will ſay / that we might heare many comfortable truths taught by theyr Preachers / and many good prayers conceyved by them. Yet ſuch is their caſe / as we can not do this neyther / but we muſt needs partake with the Miniſtery of Antichriſt: all theyr Preachers (even the beſt) being Prieſts and Deacons / ſo made by the Prelates.

                  <p>This then is not rightly to vſe <hi>that diverſity of judgement,</hi> wherevnto in many things all Churches and Chriſtians in deed are continually ſubiect here on earth / but ignorantly to abuſe it.

THe defence of the Churches and Miniſtery of <hi>England</hi> were an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe worth the taking in hand, if Maiſter <hi>Iacob</hi> effected in deed what the Title of his Book pretendeth in ſhow. But he that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his book and mindeth it well, ſhall find him promiſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and performe molehils. Let the ſequell ſhew it.</p>
                     <p>Now I would that <hi>Maiſter Iacob</hi> ſhould ſpeak himſelf (without ſtammering) what <hi>Churches</hi> and what <hi>Miniſterie</hi> of <hi>ENGLAND</hi> he defendeth. All, or ſome only? It is a poynt needfull to be knowen and mentioned. All may ſee, it would giue great light for deciding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy betwen vs. And who would not think, he ſhould readily declaer it? Yet he flies from it every where. Therefore that he may not alway ſo doe, but may be drawen to anſwer directly vnto it, (as alſo for the Readers better help, and more clearing of the truth) I wil particulerly and as plainely as I can deſcribe how the <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Miniſterie</hi> of England are to be conſidered: And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> expect his aunſwer. If I be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, or if maiſter <hi>Iacob</hi> and ſuch as liue in that Church (who therefore haue better occaſion to know it) can do it more fully and plainely, I ſhal willingly heare it. In the meane time, this is my iudgment: Firſt for the <hi>Churches,</hi> to conſider them as followeth.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In reſpect of the Conuocation-houſe, which conſiſteth of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and ſome other of the Prieſts, aſſembled togeather with them. And ſo they haue but one <hi>Church</hi> in the Land: And that when there is a Parliament, or like occaſion. I take it alſo that out of this Church the Prince, the Nobles, and people are excluded. Saue that when they haue determined their matters, they haue for ſome of them the conſent of the Parliament.</p>

                     <p>Then in al theſe conſider fower things, 1. their office, 2. their entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, 3. their Adminiſtration, 4. their maintenance. This for the <hi>Miniſterie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now let <hi>M. Iacob</hi> tell vs in his next, 1. whether he defend all theſe <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Miniſterie</hi> of England, or but ſome of them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If not all but ſome only, which then they are that he defendeth, and which he leaveth as vtterly vnlawfull without all defence.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For thoſe he defendeth, let him ſhow in what place and pages of his book we may find the defence of them. For whether it be that I perceyue it not, or that he doth it not, of this I am ſure for my ſelf, that I cannot find in al his book ſo much as any one of them defended. As o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers find, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeak. And to put al out of doubt, let <hi>M. Iacob</hi> ſhew it.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly (if he will be intreated) let him tell the cauſe why his book, being entituled <hi>A defence of the Churches &amp; Miniſterie of England,</hi> came not out <hi>Cum priuilegio.</hi> Yea why it was printed beyond ſea, and not in England. It is a ſhrewd token (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering the title) that his <hi>Defence</hi> euen at home amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his neighbours is accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted very weak and ſimple.</p>
                     <p>For the name <hi>Browniſts,</hi> by which we are reproched in the forefro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his book, note theſe things. 1. That in like manner long ſince by the Prieſts and Phariſees were the Apoſtles and Primitiue Churches ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 24.5.</note> 
                        <hi>a ſect of Nazarites:</hi> and at this day by the Papiſts are the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Goſpel called <hi>Calviniſts, Zuinglians, Huguenotes,</hi> and the like. 2. <hi>M. Browne</hi> (from whoſe name this byword was firſt taken vp) is a member and Miniſter of <hi>M.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the apoſtaſy and falſe worſhip wherein they are. So then not we, but <hi>M.

For our ſelues, we acknowledg (with the diſciples in the Primitiue Churches and the faithful in al ages ſince) that we are<note n="‡" place="margin">Act. 11.26.</note>

Therefore doth it not trouble vs, that by <hi>M. Iacob</hi> or any other we are thus reuiled for the name of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>It is inough for vs, that the<note n="†" place="margin">1 Pet. 4.14.</note> ſpirit and truth of God, which on their part is euil ſpoken of, is on our part glorified.

THe aunſwer of this Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t followeth.

                     <p>The <hi>ARGVMENT</hi> is this:<lb/>
Whatſoeuer is ſufficient to make a particular man ſtand in Antichriſtian eſtate, and in that reſpect to be ſubiect to wrath; That is ſufficient to make a companie ſo gathered togeather likewiſe to ſtand: though they profeſſe withall in their conſtitution many doctrines of truth otherwiſe profitable to ſaluation.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> is not abſolutely true, as now (by his defence of the Aſſumption) it appeareth he vnderſtandeth it. The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is not only falſe, as was proued in the<note n="*" place="margin">My firſt au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vver vvas the 3.

                     <p>For whereas in the Propoſition, mention is made not only of <hi>the making of a true Chriſtian,</hi> but alſo of <hi>a companie ſo gathered togeather:</hi> he ſhould in the Aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (if he would haue had it ſound and perfect) not only haue aſſumed, <hi>that the doctrine &amp;c. is ſufficient to make a true Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian:</hi> but haue added alſo, <hi>that their aſſemblies be companies ſo gathered together.</hi> Which being not done, both the Aſſumption wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth one of the feet, and the <hi>Concluſion</hi> inferreth more then was in the premiſſes, and ſo the whole <hi>Syllogiſme</hi> is faultie and diſfigured.</p>
                     <p>Thus might we, without any further aunſwer, returne this <hi>Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi>

to the firſt framers of it, to be better faſhioned: Yet in hope to doe them good (by the bleſſing of God) we will more particularly lay open the weakenes of this Replie.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, where he ſaith <hi>the Propoſition is moſt certain,</hi> and yet in his defence of the Aſſumption, declareth that he ſo taketh it, as whatſoeuer amongſt them, be ioyntly togeather held, and ioyned with that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe might make a true Chriſtian or true Church, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they are ſo to be reputed, as if there were no ſuch additions or commixtures: we aunſwer that in this ſence, the Propoſition neither is nor can be abſolutly true. For who knoweth not, that<note n="‡" place="margin">Gal. 5.2.4.</note> ſuch things may be ioined with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as do aboliſh from him? And again,<note n="†" place="margin">2 cor. 6.14.15.16.17.</note> 
                        <hi>that Chriſt &amp; Antichriſt cannot accord together?</hi> Either therefore the <hi>Propoſition</hi> is not general, but admitteth limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not the Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t good: Or if it be generall, without any limitation (ſo as whatſoeuer be added to or commingled with that which otherwiſe might make a true Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or Church, yet it hindereth nothing at all) then is it not alway true: as may appeare by the former exceptions and many mo that might be alledged.</p>
                     <p>Next touching the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> beſides that it is ſame, it is alſo vntrue as hath ben proued. Some balme in deed this man bringeth to cure it: but it hath no other effect, ſaue only to manifeſt ſo much the more, that the ſoare of their Aſſemblies cannot be healed. In our former aunſwer we firſt tooke 3. Exceptions againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, comparing together their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and practiſe, then we alleadged 9.

Before I examine this your aunſwer, I will deſire you and all others, to note that all your Ecceptions and Reaſons, with your defence of them, hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter following, doe conſiſt of theſe three generall pointes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That euerie perſon in England, holding our publique faith, is no true <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That all the Chriſtians &amp; Churches in King Edwards time, &amp; namely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                        <hi>Maiſter Cranmer, M. Ridley, M. Hooper, M. Latimer, M. Philpot, M. Saunders,</hi> M. <hi>Rogers, M. Tailor, &amp;c.</hi> were all lims of Antichriſt, and no true Chaiſtians.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That euery ſoule in England, is conuicted in conſcience, that the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is vnlawfull and vntolerable.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt of theſe, is our maine queſtion, and the ground of all our reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: which you gainſay. The ſecond, though it be not expreſly ſpoken, yet it is directly, euidently, and vndeniably concluded, by all and euery of your arguments againſt vs. As in the ſeueralls hereafter we ſhal ſee. The third you are driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto, for defence of your former Aſſertion, which els falleth to the grounde. And this you affirme flatly in your defence of your 1. 6. and 7. Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Now my deſire is, that all men would take notice of theſe your 3. Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and conſider indifferently, whether they proceed from an honeſt, a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:177485:18"/>
or a Chriſtian minde. And you M. Iohnſon, if you liſt hereafter to ſay any more, defend theſe 3. pointes directly and plainly, that your aunſwers may be briefer, and more certain, then now they are.</p>
                     <p>And novv I come to the particular examination of your former aunſvver.<lb/>
Firſt you ſay, <hi>You omitted the Propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, not for the ſoundnes of it, but only, becauſe you would ſee how I meant it.</hi> Why? He that hath but half an eie, may ſee the meaning of thoſe wordes, where is no darknes nor doubtfulnes of ſence at all. What fault finde you in it now? Forſooth, firſt a want in Aſſumption, and then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes, both in the Propoſition, and Aſſumption of my Sillogiſme. There vvanteth (you ſay) that I ſhould expreſſe in the Aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>That our Aſſemblies be companies gatherd togeather in the doctrines &amp; ordinances which we all by lawe publiquely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and practise.</hi> Who but a wrangler would not vnderſtand that I meant ſo much? Nay doe not my expreſſe wordes implie aſmuch: when I ſay, We by law publiquelie profeſſe and practiſe them? Then are not our Aſſemblies (which are by law) gathered together in this profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; power? Fy forſhame theſe are ſenceleſſe cauilations.

                     <p>You muſt know M.

                        </gap>op your mouth, I will declare what my mind is and hath ben concerning them.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, your wordes are, <hi>That euerie perſon in England, holding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> your publique faith, is no true Chriſtian.</hi> Touching this point, I mind the eſtate of your people two waies: The one concerning their ſeverall perſons conſidered a part from the conſtitution of your Church; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning their eſtate and ſtanding in that conſtitution. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the former of theſe, (that is, <hi>conſidering them apart from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi>) I acknowledge that in diuers of them there appeareth ſuch knowledg and faith of the goſpel with the frutes thereof, as they may well be thought, in regard of Gods election in Chriſt, to be heires of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and in that reſpect to be true Chriſtians: God pardoning vnto them their ſtanding vnder Antichriſt, which they doe not ſee or mind. But withall, I feare leaſt many mo heretofore were pertakers of this grace, then be now ſince your Antichriſtian eſtate and the vnlawfulnes to abide therein hath bin diſcouered. Concerning the latter, (that is, <hi>in reſpect of their eſtate and ſtanding in that conſtitution of your Church</hi>) I am perſwaded whoſoeuer ſo ſtand holding your publique faith and multitude of Antichriſtian abhominations withall, they cannot by the word of God be iudged true Chriſtians, as touching their outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in that church of yours: but ſtand all ſubiect to wrath, God impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this their ſinne vnto them. And that all therefore who will be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Gods mercie and ſaluation, ought with ſpeed to goe out of your Church, it ſtill remaining in Antichriſtian eſtate.</p>
                     <p>To make this matter more plaine, take out of <hi>Iſraell</hi> an example in <hi>Abiiah</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ieroboam.</hi> If you conſider him, as ſtanding with the reſt in that apoſtaſie and Church-conſtitution of Iſraell, he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to like condemnation with them in that eſtate. But if you conſider him apart from it, as there is found in him ſome goodnes towards the Lord God of Iſraell, he may be counted a true Iſraelite finding mercy at the Lords hands. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.1.5.13. By this you may ſee what my mind in this firſt point is and alway hath ben. And if you doe marke, whereſoeuer I ſpeak of the members of your Church to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wrath, in Antichriſtian eſtate, no true Chriſtians, or iointly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no true Churches, or the like: I ſpeake it ſtill with this caution, <hi>in reſpect of ſuch eſtate or conſtitution as they ſtand in vnder Antichriſt.</hi> To
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:177485:19"/>
which end you may euerie where in my aunſwers minde theſe and the like clauſes, <hi>In that eſtate, In that conſtitution, In reſpect of the Miniſterie and conſtitution of the Church, Being ſubiect to Antichriſt, Being ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, Being Antichriſtian,</hi> and other of like ſorte.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For the ſecond your words are, <hi>That all the Chriſtians and Churches in King Edvvards tyme, and namely M. Cranmer. M. Ridley, M. Hooper, M. Latimer, M. Philpot, M. Saunders, M. Rogers, M. Tailor, &amp;c. vvere all lims of Antichriſt and no true Chriſtians.</hi> Now as touching this matter, although you may eaſily ſee what my minde is by that I haue ſaid concerning the other going before: yet for this in particular, know alſo that I am thus minded, <hi>viz.</hi> That al the chriſtians and chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in King Edwards time, and namely <hi>M. Cranmer, M. Ridley, &amp;c.</hi> ſtood as touching the outward conſtitution of that church in Antichriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian eſtate: Yet conſidering the mercie of God vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes in thoſe things which in that time of ignorance were reuealed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as afterward they loued not their liues vnto death, but in many waightie pointes reſiſted vnto blood ſtriuing againſt Antichriſt, I hold them in this reſpect <hi>true Chriſtians,</hi> and now to be at reſt with the Lord.</p>
                     <p>And tell me your ſelf <hi>M. Iacob,</hi> whether you iudge not thus of <hi>Arnol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus de villa noua, Iohannes de rupe ſciſſa, Iohn Wicleff, Iohn Hus, Ierome of Prage, Sauanarola, Dominicus, Silueſter, Thorpe, Swinderby, Bilney, &amp;c.</hi> the faithfull witneſſes of Chriſt in their ſeuerall ages, and therefore in this reſpect true <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> whereas yet notwithſtanding as touching their miniſterie and Church-conſtitution wherein they were, they ſtood in Antichriſtian eſtate, ſome of them being Friers, ſome popiſh Prieſts, ſome ſaying Maſſe, ſome communicating in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> vntill the day they were martyred and put to death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> For the third, your wordes are, <hi>That euerie ſoule in England, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted in conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that the Prelacie is vnlawfull &amp; vntolerable.</hi> Touching this likewiſe, I neuer did nor can affirme as you haue ſet downe. Only this I know and affirme, for the generall ſtate of the Land, that a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter light is riſen vnto them in theſe daies, but they loue darknes more then light: Alſo, that many times and ſundry waies hath ben ſhewed and convinced vnto them, that <hi>the Prelacie, Prieſthood, Leiturgy &amp;c.</hi> are Antichriſtian, and therefore vnlawful and vntolerable: Finally, that the <note n="*" place="margin">VVitneſſe their Acts in Parlament a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt vs. Their preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t eſtate, prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, &amp;c.</note> vniuerſal face of the Realme hath refuſed the truth by vs profeſſed, and retaineth ſtill the Antichriſtian abhominations aforeſaid. For which I feare their iudgment will be the heauier. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.19 <hi>and</hi> 15.22. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.45.46.</p>
                     <p>This is that which I haue bin and am perſwaded touching theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. The latter branch of the firſt of theſe, is our maine queſtion, and the ground of all our reaſoning: which I haue proued by many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments both from the word of God and your owne mens writings. Vnto which <hi>M. Iacob</hi> you haue not giuen one word of ſound aunſwer in all your booke, but continually fly from the point in queſtion: as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:177485:19"/>
(I feare) in your ſelf, that there can be no iuſt defence of your Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches eſtate in this behalf. And touching all three, your ſelf could not but know that my iudgment therein was as I haue declared: you and I haue ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had ſpeach together thereabout. Yet behold to make the truth of God and my defence thereof more odious to the world, and ſo to preiudice your Readers iudgment, you haue here at firſt vniuſtly and falſly fathered vpon me theſe three aſſertions, being not able to ſhew them in my words or writings any where. Remember you not, how the enemies of Gods grace delt of old with the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.8.</note> blaming them (vniuſtly) as if they had taught, <hi>vve ſhould doe euil that good might come thereof.</hi> Or mind you, how the Papiſts, Anabaptiſts, and the like doe at this day charge vs (though falſly) <hi>that vve make God the author of ſin,</hi> whiles we maintaine againſt them the truth touching Predeſtination, Freewill <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In like manner deale you with me.<note place="margin">See Mat. 26 60.61. vvith Ioh. 2 19.21. Act. 6.13.14.</note> And thus at firſt you become a falſe witnes, both in peruerting the ſence of my words, and in altering, diminiſhing, and adding vnto them. Euerie of which you know is to beare falſe teſtimony, not only againſt me, but in this caſe euen againſt the truth it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>That all men <hi>take notice</hi> both of theſe poſitions, and of our dealing therein, I alſo am content and deſirous. My aunſwers (I confeſſe) are ſomewhat long, partly becauſe I would make the truth manifeſt euen to the moſt ſimple, partly for that I would more fully diſcouer your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold ſhifts and leaue you no ſtatting hole any where. In your replies (which may well be pinned vp in a narrow roome, ſeeing they haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of waight in them) I deſire more ſound and vpright dealing, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with demonſtration of your cauſe from the Scripture. That I haue cauſe thus to deſire, theſe three points following (which I wiſh the Reader to obſerue in your Replies) will teſtifie.</p>
                     <p>Firſt that you being to proue your cauſe and Argument,<note place="margin">Three things to be noted by the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Mr Iacobs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes.</note> neuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed (though you be ſtill called vpon) to make due proof thereof, but put ouer all proof vnto me: and buſie your ſelfe in aunſwering (after your faſhion) the Exceptions and Reaſons I brought againſt your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that in aunſwering my Reaſons and Exceptions (finding them all to heauy) you neuer directly refute them as they were propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but ſome times leaue moſt waightie points in them wholy vnaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; ſomtimes labour to waſh your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the matter, and to turne ouer the plea from your ſelfe that haue vndertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, to the ſtate of your Church on whom you leaue it; ſomtimes tranſforme them into other ſhapes framed by your ſelf, and ſo aunſwer not me, but fight with your owne ſhadow: and thus euerie foot yeeld the cauſe by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly that in ſteed of Gods word (which is very rare with you in all this diſpute) you preſſe vs with the authoritie of Man: neuer going about to approue your Church-eſtate by the Scriptures (which onely
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:177485:20"/>
muſt end this controuerſie) but alway leading vs to the view and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Martyrs. For let it be minded, whether euery of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies haue not this for their foundation and vnderſong, <hi>M. Cranmer M. Ridley, &amp;c.</hi> as if for our faith and worſhip of God, we ſhould turne from the liuing God to dead men,<note place="margin">Eſa. 8.20.</note> from the law and teſtimony of the Lord, to the opinions and aberrations of Man. I might beſides wiſh the Reader to mind the vnſauerie ſalt of your raiſing and reprochfull ſpeaches ſcattered throughout your book: but I omit it.</p>
                     <p>And now I come to the particular examination of this Replie of yours.</p>
                     <p>You ſay, <hi>He that hath but half an eye, may ſee the meaning of the vvordes of your Propoſition &amp;c.</hi> Well <hi>Mr. Iacob:</hi> then your ſelf hauing two eyes might eaſily ſee, I omitted the <hi>Propoſition,</hi> not for the darknes or doubtfulnes of the words, but becauſe it yet appeared not how your ſelf vnderſtood them: whether ſo, as you make the <hi>Propoſition</hi> general, admitting no exception: or particular and to be reſtrained. And why do you not yet tel vs how you take it? Are you afraid to ſay either the one or the other? either that it is general, or that it is particular?</p>
                     <p>If you make it <hi>general</hi> admitting no limitation, then is your <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> falſe,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Page.</hi> 5.</note> as I ſhowed in my laſt aunſwer, which you cannot gaineſay. If it be <hi>particular,</hi> then is your Syllogiſme a meer Sophiſme, your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of no moment, neither in any Mood or Figure. How think you <hi>Mr. Iacob?</hi> Is not your reaſon very ſound and Clerklike? But you perhaps with two eyes ſee not ſo much as others may with half an eye.</p>
                     <p>Touching the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> (to follow your words in order) I ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that wheras in the Propoſition you ſpake of <hi>a companie ſo gathered togeather,</hi> you ſhould for your purpoſe haue aſſumed <hi>that your Aſſemblies be companies ſo gathered.</hi> And tel me, ought you not ſo to haue don, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you make but one Syllogiſme? If you ought, is it <hi>vvrangling</hi> to ſhew what is wanting in your Reaſon? If you ought not, why haue you now made an addition to your Aſſumption which was not before? Is it becauſe I ſhould not ſtumble at a ſtraw? or is it not becauſe the Argument is vnſound without it, though you note the contrarie in the margent? If it be ſound without this, why doe you not ſo proue it? If it be not, why doe you not confeſſe it? Nay, why are you both ſo conceited in your ſelf, and ſo deſirous to blind your Reader, as when the fault is ſhewed you, yet you wil not onely not accknowledg it, but lay the blame vpon him that would draw you to ſee it? This in deed is not to ſtumble at a ſtraw, but wilfully to fall downe, when you might be holpen vp. Now although you be vnworthy of any further help: Yet becauſe I I would haue you ſee it, I wil once againe labour to make it plaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, if I can beat it into your head.</p>
                     <p>You make but one Syllogiſme, and in it you conclude <hi>your publique Aſſemblies to be true Churches.</hi> Now you know (I ſuppoſe) that alwaies in a good Argument, whatſoeuer is in the Concluſion, muſt needes be in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:177485:20"/>
one of the premiſſes before. But in yours it is not ſo. Your concluſion is of <hi>your publique</hi> aſſemblies, and yet you neuer ſpake of them before in either of the premiſſes. Can you by this perceive how extremely faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vnſound your Argument is.</p>
                     <p>But you think to help your ſelf by ſaying, <hi>you meant ſo much.</hi> Sure you are neare driuen <hi>M. Iacob.</hi> For what wrangler could not ſo help out any matter? Yet here you ſtay not. Euen <hi>your words</hi> (you ſay) <hi>imply as much.</hi> And do they indeed? Tell me then, whether here you include and defend <hi>all</hi> the publique Aſſemblies of the Land as they now ſtand, or but <hi>ſome</hi> of them? whether thoſe, that haue <hi>dumbe Miniſters,</hi> aſwell as thoſe that haue <hi>Preachers?</hi> whether thoſe that haue <hi>non reſidents,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as thoſe, that haue <hi>their Incumbents?</hi> whether the <hi>Cathedral</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches aſwell as the <hi>Pariſhes?</hi> For all theſe are <hi>by Law Churches</hi> among you: the Cathedrall, the Pariſhionall, thoſe that haue <hi>non reſidents,</hi> or humbe dogs, with fower Sermons a yeare, Pluralities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then tell me, whether all theſe Aſſemblies of yours be <hi>companies by Lavv gathered together in that profeſſion &amp; practiſe,</hi> wherof you ſpeak? Beſides, where the words in your Propoſition were of companies <hi>ſo gathered together &amp;c.</hi> and you in your addition to the Aſſumption haue in ſteed thereof, companies <hi>gathered together in the doctrines &amp;c.</hi> why are you ſo vnconſtant and fearefull in your words? why do you not keep the ſame termes? why made you not the addition, as was ſhowed you it ought to haue ben? Did you think, that then I would and might the more call vpon you for proof thereof? That belike was the matter. For in deed I do and muſt needs ſo much the more cal for it. And how will you ever prove it, <hi>that your Aſſemblies are companies ſo gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> that is, by a free voluntary profeſſion of the truths among you (<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 2.41. &amp; 11.24. Pſal. 110.3. Eſa. 44.5. 2 Cor. 6.17.18. and 9.13. Zach. 8.21 23. 1 Theſ. 1.6.</note> ſuch as is in true CHRIſtians, and in the manner of gathering euery true Church): when as you are <hi>by Lavv</hi> compelled ſo to profeſſe, or rather to ſubmit to that profeſſion? Yea and by compulſion of <hi>Lavv</hi> are gathered not only in and vnto thoſe truths, but in and to Antichriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian errors, which cannot ſtand therewithall? I pray you <hi>M.

                     <p>Next, where you charge me with <hi>ſtrange dealing</hi> for ſaying, <hi>your vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting declared that you ſo took the Propoſition as vvhatſoeuer</hi>

HOw fit or vnfit the <hi>deſcription</hi> is, I neither did, nor doe examine. Onely becauſe it is your owne profeſſion, and your practiſe is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnto it, I did from hence take the firſt Exception, requiring of you to proue your Aſſemblies to be ſuch, or els to know that your owne doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, is a witnes againſt your ſelues. Now in your Reply, haue you according to the particulers of that deſcription, iuſtified your Church aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies? Nothing leſſe. Let this therefore be firſt obſerued. But what then haue you done?</p>
                     <p>Firſt pretending as if you repeated our exception, and your owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, you leaue out diuers particulers, of ſpeciall moment, there expreſſed. As firſt, where the viſible Church is deſcribed to be <hi>a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faithfull men,</hi> you leaue out theſe wordes <hi>(of faithfull men)</hi> belike knowing that your Congregations, which are holds of all foule ſpirits, and cages of euery vncleane and hatefull bird,<note place="margin">Reuel. 18.2</note> cannot therefore iuſtly be accounted congregations of faithfull men. Secondly, where the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription ſpeaketh of <hi>the Sacraments to be duely miniſtred,</hi> you / leaue out this word <hi>(duely):</hi> becauſe it croſſeth your womens Baptiſme, priuate Communion, receiuing of the moſt prophane and their ſeed among you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Laſtly, where in the deſcription it is required, both for preaching the pure word and due adminiſtration of the Sacraments, that they be don according to Chriſtes ordinance: you leaue out theſe words <hi>(according to Chriſtes ordinance):</hi> belike becauſe this clauſe quite overthroweth both your Antichriſtian Prelacy, from whih al the inferior Miniſters among you receiue power and authority to preach and miniſter the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; and your Preiſthood and Deaconry, wherein you all adminiſter; and your ſtinted impoſed prayers, exhortations, croſſes in the forehead, queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Infantes, vſe of the ſame wordes in Engliſh in miniſtring the Lords Supper, which the Papiſts vſed and ſtill vſe in Latine, not retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the words of Chriſtes inſtitution: and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>Thus hauing left out ſuch particulers as were of ſpeciall moment againſt you, yet you demaund <hi>vvherein your paactize is contrary to your profeſſion, and deſcription of a viſible Church, in vvhat things that of neceſſitie are requiſite?</hi> We aunſwer, in all the particulers of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription

                     <p>Secondly, in the ſame deſcription is required, <hi>That the pure vvord of God be preached, according to Chriſtes ordinance.</hi> But with you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed beſides the word of God, the Apocrypha books: and in ſteed of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the word, the reading of Homilies: as may appeare in that<note n="‡" place="margin">Book of Articles pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liſhed Anno 1502.</note> book of Articles alledged by your ſelf. Yet who knoweth not, that in thoſe bookes are diuers vntruths, errors, contradictions, blaſphemies, and ſuch like? So farre are they from being the pure word of God, or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therewith. Moreouer, when and where the word is preached among you, it is done by vertue of a falſe office and calling, never appointed by Chriſt. And the Miniſters that preach it, do in your conſtitution alway ſtand ſubiect to be ſilenced, ſuſpended, excommunicated, and degraded by the Prelates and Ordinaries, to whom (when you are made Prieſts, you promiſe, and (when you enter vpon a benefice) you ſweare, Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call obedience.

HEre is much adoe to no purpoſe. You obſerue 4. pointes in our Article omitted by me, wherein our practiſe is contrarie to our profeſſion. Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                        <hi>our Article requireth a viſible Church to be an aſſemblie of faithfull men: But our oſſemblies</hi> (ſay you) <hi>are not ſo.</hi> This is falſe, they are ſo: you ſhall neuer proue in vs the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, more then appeareth was in the Church of the Iewes, both Auncient and in the time of Chriſt, and yet they than were the true Church: As I haue elſwhere in this book ſufficiently proued and ſhewed againſt you. That which you bring of <hi>D. VVhitgift</hi> and other writers amongſt vs of the prophaneſſe of many in our aſſemblies, you depraue their meaninges vtterly: for though they graunt very many ſuch to be amongſt vs, yet they ſay not, that all our aſſemblies are ſuch, nor our whole aſſemblies: Neither denie they our aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies to be companies of faithfull men, or vtterly to be ſeparated from: Nay, the contrary do they: euen that onely they ought to be reformed. Therefore you too groſly abuſe them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The Article requireth the pure word of God to be preached.</hi> But (ſay you) the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Apocrypha books, and reading of Homilies, and other errors are allowed in our practiſe: Yea ſurely and in our profeſſion too: as your ſelf obſerueth in the book of Artic. yet then our profeſſion &amp; practiſe differ not, as you charg our Churches. But theſe pointes are not <hi>the pure word of God:</hi> Neither doth the Article meane, that in a viſible Church, euery iot and title, both of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and practiſe, muſt needs be out of the pure word. They knew that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry viſible Church might and did erre in ſomewhat: Onely it meaneth, that a viſible Church might not erre in any poinct, that of neceſſity is requiſite, as their words expreſſe. It reſteth then that you ſhew, that the pure word is not preached in our aſſemblies by law, ſufficiently to ſalvation: which yet you do not, nor can doe. Therefore you ſay nothing. For, I for my part knovv wel, that our Churches faile from the pure word in ſundry leſſer points, which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:177485:24"/>
though they be errors, yet are they not Fundamentall, neither doe they in their owne nature aboliſh from Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Article hath, <hi>according to Christes ordinance:</hi> But you ſay, <hi>that we preach in ſtrange and falſe functions, ſuch as are not Christes ordinances.</hi> This is falſe too, Our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ordinary Preachers are true Paſtours, as touching the ſubſtance of Paſtorall calling, as I haue often aunſwered you, albeit they haue a wrong ordination from the Prelacie.

If you think they do, ſay ſo, and you ſhall be refuted. If nay, then this verie Article ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth ſo much, That corruptions and faults might be in the Sacraments, but nothing amiſſe that of neceſſitie is requiſite.</p>
                     <p>Novv, <hi>all theſe</hi> 4. <hi>poinctes I haue omitted</hi> (ſay you.)

If I haue (as it is moſt true) then doe you vnconſcionably abuſe me, in ſaying, I pretended to repeate our deſcription in the Article, and yet leaue out diuers particulars of ſpeciall moment. And let this therefore be firſt obſerued, I haue omitted nothing materiall in that Article. Yea let this be here noted, that in all this you haue moſt fondly abuſed yout penne and tounge.</p>
                     <p>Yet vyill you ſtill demaund <hi>how our practiſe agreeth with our profeſſion in that</hi> 19. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle?</hi> Still I annſvver you vvith that ſimilitude of a fooliſh and importunate Tenaunt againſt his Landlord.

Euen ſo as abſurd it is for you, ſeeing at firſt you vvere of vs and novv are gone out from vs, to put vs to proue our ſelues to be ſuch as heretofore you neuer doubted of.

Thirdly, I take the whole Land to witnes againſt you, that it is moſt falſe which here you are not aſhamed with ſuch boldnes to affirme, <hi>viz. that your Church-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies are Congregations of faithfull men.</hi> But by this may all men ſee you make no conſcience what you affirme or denie, ſo you may ſeeme to ſay ſomewhat.

Vnto which I might adde an hundred mo teſtimonies of theirs, if the caſe were not as cleare as the Sunne at noone day.</p>
                     <p>But you ſay, <hi>I depraue their meanings vtterly.</hi> Why ſo, I pray you? <hi>Becauſe they ſay not, that all your Aſſemblies are ſuch, nor your vvhole Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, though they graunt very many ſuch to be among you:</hi> that is, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of your Church to be <hi>Atheiſts, Papiſts, Drunkards, Whoremongers, Thieves, Murtherers, Witches, &amp;c.</hi> Alas <hi>M. Iacob,</hi> it pittieth me to ſee your extreame follie and evill conſcience. Your follie, that ſee not how both they and you giue the cauſe in this graunt: and therby alſo teſtifie that I do not at all deprave their meanings. Is it poſſible, that your Church-aſſemblies ſhould be full of ſuch knowen vngodly perſons, and yet be Congregations of faithful men? It never entred into my thought, much
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:177485:25"/>
leſſe did I ever ſay it, <hi>that your whole Aſſemblies are ſuch.</hi> I know and willingly accknowledg many of your Church not to be ſo: for which I praiſe God. (Alwaies I except your publike worſhip and Idolatrie, wherein all, even the beſt among you, are inwrapped.) This I ſaid, <hi>that your Aſſemblies are not congregations of faithful men, but a confuſion of all manner of people, though never ſo vvicked.</hi> And this you ſee do your owne men teſtifie.</p>
                     <p>Adde herevnto, that both they and your ſelf graunt your Aſſemblies herein <hi>ought to be reformed.</hi> If they be already Congregations of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, what reformation would you haue in this behalf? But if their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> eſtate herein be ſuch, as they ought to be reformed: why are you ſo ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and fooliſh, thus to ſpeake as you do in all this matter? Beſides your folly, you bewray an evill conſcience, in aſmuch as you denie that thing, the light whereof doth ſo ſhine in your conſcience, as even whiles you would ſhift it of, you are conſtrained to acknowledg it whether you will or not.</p>
                     <p>Where you ſpeak of your owne men, <hi>that they deny not your Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies to be companies of faithfull men, or vtterly to be ſeperated from:</hi> it is to no purpoſe at all ſaue againſt your ſelfe. For firſt, though they ſpeak it not in theſe very ſyllables, yet the thing it ſelf neceſſarily followeth vpon their words. It is without queſtion that the <hi>heathen Poets</hi> did themſelues worſhip Idols: yet notwithſtanding ſometimes they ſo ſpake in their writings, as Paull doth<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 17.28.29.</note> from thence conclude that not Idols but the true God onely is to be worſhipped. Had it now ben of waight, for any of them to have alleadged againſt the Apoſtle, <hi>that theit Poets did not deny Idols to be worſhipped?</hi> Yet you think it ſufficient, to withſtand the truth with any ſuch pretence. Let this once ſpoken, ſerve for aunſwer to all your reproches wherewith you burden me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times for the collections which I deduce neceſſarily from your owne and other mens writings. Secondly, you are to know that it is not materiall againſt me, whatſoever your men doe graunt or denie. But againſt you it is, who abide in the ſame Miniſterie and of the ſame Church with them. For that which you ſpeak <hi>of the Church of the Iewes both auncient and in the time of Chriſt,</hi> referring vs to another place hereafter in this book for proof of your compariſon, look you there alſo for aunſwer therevnto. And hitherto of the firſt point of your Article and profeſſion differing from your practiſe and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond, if you profeſſe to preach <hi>the pure vvord of God</hi> (as this Article requireth) and yet againe both in profeſſion and practiſe (as here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> you acknowledg) preach the impure and lying writings of Men, ſuch as be <hi>the Apocrypha books and your Homilies:</hi> what is or can be more contrarie?

Neither ſhall any ever know what your profeſſion is, if your Articles doe thus croſſe one another, and your practiſe alſo agree with

the worſt.</p>
                     <p>But to cleare this point, I aunſwer furthermore: 1. that it is a point of neceſſitie requiſite, <hi>that Gods vvord onely be taught.</hi> For which ſee theſe Scriptures, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>and</hi> 12.32. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.113. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.5.6. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>and</hi> 59.21. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23: 16.28. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.39. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3.4.5. <hi>and</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8.9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18.19.

The <hi>Apocrypha books</hi> maintained in the Church (which you ſay is both your profeſſion and practiſe) overthroweth the truth of Chriſtian religion, and bringeth in Iudaiſme, Popery, Atheiſme, and what not? 3. Even in the Church of Rome where <hi>theſe books</hi> alſo are received, yet withal the pure word is ſo preached among them by Law, as no doubt to ſome is ſufficient co ſalvation.

Thus might you more perſwade vs, and defend your ſelues better, in one half ſheet of paper, then in a thouſand ſuch frivolous pamphlets as you ſparſe abroad, to no purpoſe at all, except it be to lay open your owne nakednes ſo much the more.</p>
                     <p>Whereas I alledged, <hi>that vvhen and vvhere the vvorde is preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, it is done by vertue of a falſe office and calling, never appointed by Chriſt:</hi> this you ſay is falſe too. Often have I heard you ſay ſo, but never could I heare you proue it. To help you therefore, I will ſhow you the way how to doe it, if any ſuch thing could be. And that is thus: firſt, ſyncerely (as before God) to reckon vp all the offices of Miniſtery which your Church by Law enjoyeth; and then to note the Scriptures which teach that Chriſt ordained thoſe offices in his Church: ſecondly, to ſhow the manner of entrance into your ſeverall offices preſcribed by Law; and then, to name the places of Scripture where ſuch calling is appointed by Chriſt. This you ſee is a plaine and ready way (touching theſe two points) to ſtabliſh the conſcience and to confound your adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, not with ſhow of words, but with ſubſtance of matter. I hope it will do you ſome pleaſure <hi>Mr. Iacob,</hi> that I haue ſhowed you ſo good a way. All the thanks I aſke for it is, that you would walk vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it.</p>
                     <p>Now if you liſt not take the paines, or find the way all to hard, for your Archbs, Lordbs, Archdeacons, Parſons, Vicars, Stipendaries, and the reſt of your Prieſts and Deacons: yet at leaſt for your ſelf ſhow it in defence of your owne office and calling, firſt when you were made Prieſt and Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Prelates; and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when you became an Houſe-Prieſt in the countrey, and ſince a Mercenary-Prieſt in the citty. Now (I heare) your Lords the Prelates haue commaunded you ſilence, and you as an obedient childe of ſuch reverend Fathers do readily ſubmit to their Antichriſtian authority. Yet let this be no excuſe to put of the clearing of the former matter: but ſeeing you haue ſo much the more lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, do it the more ſoundly and ſpeedily. Doubtles it would give great light in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>Next you ſay, <hi>your ordinarie Preachers are true Paſtors, as touching the ſubſtance of Paſtorall calling:</hi> but whom meane you by <hi>ordinary Preachers
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:177485:27"/>
&amp;c.</hi> Your Prelates (I remember) are by Law your <hi>Ordinaries.</hi> Doe you meane it of them? your treatiſe ſhewes it not. Tell vs then who they be of whom you ſpeak: 1. whether all or ſome onely of your Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers: 2. whether you have any extraordinarie Preachers that have ſome other office: 3. what you judge, of thoſe that are not in the number of the ordinary Preachers you ſpeak of, whether they alſo be true Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: 4. what you account (according to the Scripture) the ſubſtance of the Paſtorall calling, whereof you ſpeak. All theſe points you ſee muſt be cleared, afore we can vnderſtand what you ſpeak, or whereof you affirme. So myſticall, or rather in deed ſo fearefull and deceitfull is your manner of ſpeach.</p>
                     <p>Touching the queſtion, <hi>what is ſubſtantiall in the Miniſtery</hi> (if you put it over to me to declare, as your manner is) I have already ſhowed my judgment and reaſons in<note n="†" place="margin">A treatiſe of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt. of the Churches of Engl. p. 83. 84. 85.</note> another treatiſe. Which you may either refute, or approue your Miniſtery according to thoſe particulars, or (if you can do neither of theſe) yeeld to the truth againſt which you have ſo long ſtrugled in vaine. In vaine, I ſay: for proof whereof marke what followeth next in your Reply.</p>
                     <p>Your ſelf confeſſe that even the Preachers for whome you plead, <hi>have a wrong ordination from the Prelacy.</hi> Thus your owne mouth (M. Iacob) is witnes againſt your ſelf, that al your labour is in vaine. Shall I yet make it more plaine vnto you? Marke then. Your maine defence is from<note n="‡" place="margin">See before, pag 3. and 6.</note> 
                        <hi>the doctrine of your Church, as it is publiquely profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and practiſed by Lavv.</hi> Now your Law admitteth no other ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that of the <hi>Prelacy.</hi> And this your ſelf here confeſſe is <hi>vvrong.</hi> In what caſe now your Miniſtery ſtandeth, let others judge. And take you heed, you pleaſe not your ſelf any longer in ſuch vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. The<note n="“" place="margin">2 The. 2.12</note> end thereof is fearefull. But beſides this eſtate of your Miniſtery, you confeſſe here alſo for the body of your Church, <hi>that you have a confuſion of people:</hi> that is (in deed, though you ſpeak it not in word) a ſpirituall Babylon. For <hi>Babel,</hi> is in Engliſh, <hi>confuſion.</hi> Thus both for Miniſtery and people, you give the cauſe, having wearied your ſelf in the defence of Babylon all in vaine. Which is and will be the fruit of your and all other mens labours in this caſe. So the<note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 51.58.64.</note> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath foretold.</p>
                     <p>Your other writing,<note n="‡" place="margin">See the next treatiſe follovving at the end of this.</note> 
                        <hi>touching the comparing of the condition of a Miniſtery vvith Mariage,</hi> long ſince deliuered, was alſo long ſince aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Vnto which I have not yet received any Reply: not ſo much as words, which is the moſt I look for from you at any time.</p>
                     <p>Where next you graunt, <hi>it is Chriſts ordinance, to haue a true Paſtor, to a faithfull people:</hi> hold you there, <hi>M.

Your diſtinction of <hi>ſimply aboliſhing</hi> is but leaven of your owne, borrowed from your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and by them from the Papiſts. We plainely affirme that your abuſes and corruptions are ſuch, as the Sacraments among you are not duely adminiſtred according to Chriſts ordinance; and that it cannot be ſhowed by the word of God that they ſeale vp Gods covenant of grace to your Church and the members thereof in that eſtate. Now ſee that (according to your promiſe) you <hi>refute</hi> this.

                     <p>The particulars of your Article, you ſay, <hi>you omitted for breuities ſake.</hi> Let others beleev you that will: for mine owne part, I neither do nor can beleev it. You have here taken paines to write an whole book, and in it a multitude of words to no purpoſe. Is it likely then, that for <hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſake</hi> you would omit the moſt ſpeciall points of the Article, which may be written in a line or two at the moſt? Nay <hi>M. Iacob,</hi> theſe clauſes <hi>(of faithfull men; duely; according to Chriſts ordinance)</hi> are ſo ful and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant againſt you, as you thouht it no wiſdome to mention them at all: but rather in ſilence to bury them vnder ſome generall terme, or (as your ſelf ſpeak) <hi>to comprehend them in a generall clauſe.</hi> This in deed was the beſt way to darken the truth and help your ſelf, if any way you could. But any that mind your manner of dealing may eaſily ſee, that if theſe clauſes had made but a tenth part ſo much for you, as they are fully againſt you: then you would have ben ſo far from omitting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as we ſhould have had them noted downe in greater letters then the reſt.</p>
                     <p>For your <hi>Article</hi> it ſelf, if the meaning of it were to comprehend thoſe points in your generall clauſe: why then did it ſo particularly mention them beſides?

                     <p>Your parable of a <hi>Landlord and a Tenaunt,</hi> beſides that it is popiſh and againſt your ſelues (as hath ben ſhewed) it is alſo falſe.

Now alſo Chriſt <hi>the King and Lord of his Church</hi> doth by his ſervants lay claime to his owne right, and diſclaimeth your falſe worſhip and Miniſterie. So your owne ſaying is againſt your ſelf, <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit Regi, No time doth preiudice the King.</hi> If you plead your right by any more auncient date, as from Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, the evidence may ſoone be ſhewed from their writings. If you doe it not, all men of wiſdome will not onely condemne your folly, who take vpon you the defence of ſo bad a cauſe, but will alſo perceive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie of your Churches eſtate, for which no warrant can be ſhewed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Apoſtolik writ.</p>
                     <p>For our going out from among you, <hi>when before we had held part of poſſeſſion with you,</hi> I brought warrant from the worde of God: which you touch not at all.</p>
                     <p>That it lieth vpon you, yea and that your ſelf have taken it vpon you, to approve your <hi>Hierarchy, Leiturgy, confuſion of people &amp;c.</hi> appeareth not onely by the title of your book, which is called <hi>A defence of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Miniſtery of England:</hi> but by reaſon alſo that you began the firſt Argument and continew to replie.

That your caſe is thus, hath ben often ſhewed by vs, both in other writings and in theſe aunſwers to your ſelf. And of this point there will be occaſion after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſpeak againe.</p>
                     <p>Touching the impudent vntruth wherewith you were charged, firſt you ſayd, <hi>your ſelves ſee not wherein you faile, touching Preaching or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, in things neceſſary.</hi> I alledged your owne men, as witneſſes to convince you therein, <hi>The Admonition, T.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:177485:28"/>
and perſiſt in the impudent vntruth laid to your charge. For hearken now, and you ſhall heare themſelves teſtifie thus much.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Admonition in the Preface ſayeth thus, <hi>In a fevv vvordes to ſpeake vvhat vve meane, Either muſt vve have a right Miniſtery of God,<note place="margin">Admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am. firſt and ſecond.</note> and a right government of his Church according to the Scriptures ſet vp (both vvhich vve lack) or els there can be no right Religion, nor yet for contempt thereof can Gods plagues be from vs any vvhile differred.</hi> And againe in the treatiſe it ſelf are theſe words, <hi>We in England are not yet come to the outvvard face of a Church agreable to Gods vvord.</hi> Or as it is written in the margent of divers of thoſe books, <hi>we are ſcarce come to the outvvard face of a Church &amp;c.</hi> Take which of theſe you pleaſe: the beſt is bad ynough.</p>
                     <p>Touching the Miniſterie in particular, the ſame book and men ſay thus, <hi>We have an Antichriſtian Hierarchy and a popiſh ordering of Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſtrange from the vvord of God and the vſe of all vvel reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the vvorld.</hi> And further, <hi>Although ſome truth be taught by ſome Preachers, yet no Preacher may vvithout daunger of the Lavves, vtter all the truth compriſed in the booke of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then touching the Sacraments, thus they write, <hi>The Sacraments are vvickedly mangled and prophaned.</hi> Alſo, <hi>In the primitive Churches they adminiſtred the Sacrament ſimply as they received it from the Lord, vve ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully mixed vvith mans inventions and deviſes.</hi> Yea they charge the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, <hi>that they doe ſuperſtitiouſly and vvickedly inſtitute a nevv Sacrament (vvhich is proper to Chriſt onely) marking the child in the forehead vvith a Croſſe, in token that hereafter he ſhall not be aſhamed to confeſſe the faith of Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And of your book of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayer, according to which your Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and other divine ſervice is adminiſtred, thus alſo they write, <hi>we muſt needes ſay that this book is an vnperfit book, culled and picked out of the Popiſh dunghill the Maſſe book, full of all abominations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude withall, thus they teſtifie concerning theſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted betweene them and the Prelates, <hi>Neyther is the controverſy betvvixt them and vs as they vvould beare the vvorld in hand, for a cap a tippet or a ſurplus, but for greater matters concerning a true Miniſtery and Regiment of the Church according to the vvord. Which things once eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, the other melt away of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues.</hi> Being <hi>(once eſtabliſhed)</hi> ſay they. Therefore yet they did not account they had them. And whereof ſpeak they? All may ſee, <hi>of a true Miniſtery and Regiment of the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now ſpeak your ſelf, <hi>Mr. Iacob.</hi> Do not theſe men teſtifie to your face, that you have avouched a bold and impudent vntruth, wilfully ſtriving againſt the cleare light? Yet I have cited but a few, and thoſe onely out of <hi>the Admonitions to the Parliament.</hi> Out of which and the reſt of their writings I might alledge a thouſand mo, to convince you herein. But that would be too tedious. And theſe (I doubt not) will cleare the point, and ſuffice any that are indifferent and godly minded. For your

IN this Exception we demaunded firſt, if you held <hi>Ieſus Chriſt to be the Prophet, Prieſt, and King of his Church,</hi> to be obeyed in his owne ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance only and in no other; then, how your practiſe agreeth with <hi>this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</hi> One would have thought it had ben needfull (if you could) to have cleared this poinct by the Scriptures, and from thence to have proved your <hi>Miniſtery, worſhip, Church gouernement, &amp;c.</hi> (which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led jn queſtion) to be no other then the <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that Prophet, Prieſt and King of his Church</hi> hath in his Teſtament given and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therevnto. But this you have not done. And let the Reader note it. But what then do you ſay?</p>
                     <p>Firſt you tell vs, <hi>That touching this poinct, your profeſſion and practiſe now is ſo as before time it vvas vvith M. Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, and their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations.</hi> But what of this? Can the perſons or age of theſe whom you name, nay can any perſon or ages preiudice the truth? Were not they ſubiect to error at all? Or muſt their errors bind vs? Did not <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> (that champion of Chriſt) and others alſo of the Martyrs in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, ſay and heare Maſſe, even to their dying day,<note place="margin">See their hiſtoryes in the Acts and Monuments</note> not ſeeing the abominations thereof?

But may we now therefore ſo profeſſe, and practiſe in theſe things as they did? Or if we ſhould, were their ignorance and errors a ſufficient defence for vs? Yet thus would you beare vs in hand.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore tell vs, if <hi>M. Latimer</hi> and others did not forſake the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy and functions they had before time received?

                     <p>Yet you ſtay not here neither, but as men that have bent their tongues like bowes for lyes, you feare not to adde further, <hi>that when the Church and Magiſtrate appointeth any ordinances</hi> (whether theſe or any other) <hi>touching the outward gouernement and ceremonies of the Church, we are to account them Chriſtes owne, who hath left this liberty to the Church for to vſe.</hi> O ſhameles mouth.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, you do yet further ſeek ſhifts and would colour the matter, by pretending <hi>That the things which concerne outward gouernement and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, are not of the foundation ſimply.</hi> But this will help you no more then the other.

If they be not, then why is this word <hi>(ſimply)</hi> added, as if you granted they were of the foundation, though not <hi>ſimply.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly we aſke, whether the outward gouernement and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ordained by Chriſt for his Church vnder the Goſpell, be not of the <hi>foundation,</hi> aſmuch as the outward gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and ceremonies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by <hi>Moſes</hi> for the Church vnder the Law? Or if they be, whether they are not as faithfully ſet downe by Chriſt, as the other were by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and as carefully to be obſerved by vs, as the other were by the Iewes: or rather more, inaſmuch as<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 3.2.3.</note>

Nay, were they not therefore <hi>vvholy</hi> to be ſeparated from, and left to the iudgment of God, which overtook them and all that <hi>ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> vnto them?

That the vvritten vvord ought of neceſſity to ſhevv vs our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard and meer ſpirituall beleif and obedience. As for the outvvard Church order, our ſtate holdeth that it is arbitrary to be appoincted and abrogated againe at the liking of the Church and Magiſtrate, And that the worde no vvhere forbiddeth this libertie: Where note in this explication tvvo thinges.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it is foule vvrong to our Churches and to my vvordes, to ſay as you do, <hi>That they meane, no outward orders at all, be matters of faith, or constant in the Scriptures.</hi> Nay it vvas neuer doubted, but to preach, to pray, to adminiſter Sacraments &amp;c. though external, yet are perpetuall things and neceſſarie and vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the Scriptures. My expreſſe vvords, and our Churches meaning is, That any reaſonable kinde of Church-gouernement, and rites, and orders, are arbitrary and changeable, no matters of faith, nor written in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; And yet ſtill Chriſt to be our onely, and abſolute King and Prophet neuertheleſſe. Whoſoeuer doth vrge vpon our Churches further, or on my wordes; doth ſlaunder and cauill, and malitiouſly depraue them and nothing elſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, note in my explication, that I iuſtifie not this opinion of our ſtate, but I ſay, Thus to beleeue and practiſe, <hi>ſimply,</hi> deſtroyeth no mans ſaluation in Chriſt, which you denying generally and vehemently in your ſixt aunſvver, you deny directly Maiſter <hi>Cranmer &amp;c.</hi> to haue held the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, or to be ſaued: vvherein, you openly profeſſe and proclaime, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond generall poinct vvhich in the beginning I charged you vvith: That all Churches and Chriſtians here in King Edvvards time, and namely Maiſter <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, Hooper, Philpot, Saunders, Rogers, Tailor, &amp;c.</hi> held not Chriſt their Prophet, Prieſt and King, and ſo conſequently they vvere lims of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt (for they bare his marke euen to their deaths) and no true Chriſtians. Alas to ſee hovv malice and preiudice hath blinded you. Is there not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cauſe for vs to cry and ſay againſt you, <hi>O ſhameleſſe mouth, O vnchriſtian hart,</hi> vvhich termes, you vainely charge vpon me? Is this you that white the Toombs of thoſe Martirs, &amp; yet in fine, condempne them for no true Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, nor their Aſſemblies for Churches?</p>
                     <p>You adde a clauſe, <hi>They that profeſſe and practiſe as doth the Church of England, &amp;c.</hi> If you meane hereby to put a difference betwene thoſe good mens holding this opinion, and our Churches now, Yea betwene your owne lately, and ours novv, ſpeake out vvhat is it? You can imagine none but this. Thoſe good men Maiſter <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, &amp;c.</hi> and your ſelfe of late, held theſe very ſame errors of the outvvard Church order vvhich vve do: But they and you, did (it ſeemeth) of ſimplicity, vve malitiouſly, they of ignorance, vve of plaine obſtinacy, and hauing a convicted and ſeared conſcience: vvhereby, they and you might be true Chriſtians for all theſe errors, but vve novv can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo. If this be your meaning, then you graunt vs our Aſſumption, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vvhich all your diſpute here is bent. You graunt it I ſay, That the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:177485:33"/>
whole doctrine, as it is by law in England, is ſufficient to make a particular man a true Chriſtian. Secondly <hi>we now erre not in theſe poincts of ſimplicity, but of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes and malice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Say you ſo? Speake that plaine then. Our whole aſſemblies? all and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our aſſemblies? of wilfulnes and of a conuicted conſcience? Are you ſure of this? Doe you know euery mans hart and conſcience ſo well? If you do, then you ſay ſomwhat indeed. But you are then neere as wiſe as God himſelfe, to know mens hearts ſo perfectly, whoſe faces you neuer ſaw; You will ſay, you know diuers, whome you dare ſay are convicted in conſcience. That is much alſo to affirme. But if you do, that ſerueth not your turne, vnleſſe all be ſo conuicted. Chriſt knew a great many in the Church of the <hi>Iewes</hi> yea of the learnedſt and cheifeſt in authority, that were conuicted in conſcience, that he was the Chriſt, who blaſphemed in denying him, and yet the Aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies then were not conuicted, they ſtill were true Churches. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this ſaying, if you ſay to the purpoſe, you then affirme the Third ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall poinct that I noted in you at the beginning of this my laſt Replie: <hi>That euery ſoule in England is conuicted in conſcience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here I maruaile that you ſay, Maiſter <hi>Hus and other of the holy Martirs did heare and ſay Maſſe till their dying day, Alſo that others did acknowledg the Popes ſupremacie.</hi> I aſke you, do you meane that they held and vſed the Popiſh Maſſe, according to all the abominations that are in it? If you thinke ſo, then ſurely neither <hi>Hus</hi> nor any of the reſt, were <hi>holy</hi> Martirs. For therein are found errors plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fundamentall, which of themſelues aboliſh from Chriſt; They are not to be compared to our publique errors now in England, The like I ſay of the Popes ſupremacy. If you thinke any of the Martirs acknowledged it in the large and ample meaning thereof, as the Popiſh Doctors do ſet it downe; Then verily neither were they any Martirs. The book of Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whither you ſend vs, affirmeth not that they held theſe errors in the largeſt and groſſeſt ſort. It may be therefore they held many and greeuous errors of ignorance, both in the Popiſh Maſſe &amp; in the ſupremacy, which might neuertheleſſe ſtand with Chriſt crucified, And ſo they might be and were holy Martirs: But I affirme, that according to the damnable groſſenes of the very Papiſts, they neither did nor could hold them. Therefore in theſe inſtances you ſay nothing to vs, nor againſt the queſtion in hand.</p>
                     <p>Further, you ſayd before in the beginning of your defence of this Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note n="“" place="margin">

                        <hi>That Maiſter Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer and the reſt of the Martirs then, neither had them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, nor ioyned in ſpirituall communion, with ſuch as had the Prelacy, and Miniſtery now plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for.</hi> Now I ſee you make no conſcience of vntruthes, yea you are bold to auouch open and knowne falſhoods. Did not Maiſter <hi>Cranmer</hi> hold him ſelfe for Archbiſhop ſtill, and that he vvas by the Pope vniuſtly and vnſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently depoſed, and by Queene Mary forcibly reſtreined from it? Did he euer repent of holding that Office till his death? Alſo did not <hi>Ridley</hi> ſtand vpon his right to the Biſhopricke of London though ready to dye? <hi>Latimer</hi> though he renounced his Biſhoprick, yet he kept his Miniſtery, and neuer repented him of it. <hi>Philpot</hi> neuer miſliked his Archdeaconry: Yea vvhen he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:177485:33"/>
refuſed bloudy <hi>Bonner,</hi> yet he appealed to his ordinary the Biſhop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter. The like minde is to be ſeene in Biſhop <hi>Farrar.</hi> And generally vvhoſoeuer vvere Miniſters then of the Prelates ordination, they neuer <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced</hi> it, though they dyed Martirs. Thus appeareth your bold vntruth in this behalfe.</p>
                     <p>Further in your Sixt anſvver Pag 32. Firſt you vvill not ſee vvhat I meane in ſaying, That theſe outvvard orders be not of the foundation <hi>ſimply:</hi> I meant, not <hi>at all</hi> of the very<note n="‡" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.2 3.4.

Greater light of the truth is now come into the world, then was in thoſe daies: but you loue darkenes rather then light. For ſtill you walk in darknes. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.11.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They witneſſed againſt the abominations of Antichriſt (then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in queſtion) to the loſſe of their libertie and lives: Your Church doth not ſo againſt the remnants of Poperie (now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troverted) but do either openly defend them, or fearefully ſubmit vnto them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They conſiſted not of ſwarmes of Atheiſts, adulterers, drunkards and all ſorts of people good and bad, even knowen wicked ones, mixed together in one body: as your Church doth.</p>

                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:177485:35"/>4. Such of them as were Miniſters were degraded from their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian functions: ſo are not yours.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. They died not members of Antichriſts Church, nor for any error they held, but for the truth: You ſtil remaine members of Antichiſtian Churches, both withſtanding the truth and maintaining errors.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. They were and died members of a true viſible Church (<hi>viz:</hi> that perſecuted Church in Queen Maries daies) which was ſeparated from the reſt of the Land as from the world, and ioyned together in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Goſpell by voluntary ſubmiſſion therevnto: though in that time of ignorance they had their wants and errors. You continew members of a falſe conſtituted Church, vnſeparated from the world, yeelding ſubiection to Antichriſtian enormityes, againſt the ordinances of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. They refuſed not the truth offred, neyther reſiſted thoſe that did iuſtly reprove theyr errors: but your Church doth both, as appeareth by your continuall practiſe, and by the books and Acts of Parliament made openly and with authority againſt vs for witneſſing the truth.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Your Prelats, Prieſts, and people (that is, your Churches) in your eſtate, are no Martyrs, but children of them which killed the Martyrs, and do at this day fill vp the meaſure of your forefathers, perſecuting to death ſuch as haue the teſtimony of Ieſus. This did not the Martyrs.</p>
                     <p>Are not you then the men that <hi>white the toombes</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> which were in former tymes: and yet your ſelves impriſon, baniſh, and kill the witneſſes of Ieſus that are among you at this day? Take heed you hearden not your hearts, but tremble at your fearefull eſtate, and pleaſe not your ſelues in vnrighteouſnes (by the error of any) neither bleſſe your ſelves ſtill in iniquitie. Hitherto of the difference between the Martyrs and your Churches.</p>
                     <p>Now for <hi>my ſelf,</hi> I confeſſe (as I did<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 8.</note> before of the Martyrs) that whiles I was Miniſter and member of your Church in that conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſtood in Antichriſtian eſtate. Yet doubt I not, but euen then, being of the elect of God, I was partaker through faith of the mercy of God in Chriſt to ſaluation. And this I hope is the caſe of divers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you. But for my ſelf, I haue now the more aſſurance, in that God hath both drawen me out of that Antichriſtian eſtate, giuing me to ſee and to forſake it, and hath planted me in his true Church and houſehold giuing me to receiue his truth in much affliction with ioy of the holy Ghoſt. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.6.</p>
                     <p>But as for you in your eſtate, beſides that yet you are not members of any true viſible Church, you do moreover abide in groſſe confuſion, falſe Miniſtery, Antichriſtian worſhip, and other abominations, by the word of God already diſcovered. Now whiles you thus remaine, you cannot in that eſtate approve your ſelves to have the promiſe of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof by the word of God you can be aſſured, vntill you depart

                     <p>Thus you ſee, how notwithſtanding any thing we eyther do or can acknowledge touching the Martyrs or ourſelves heretofore, yet ſtill we affirme and prove your eſtate to be Antichriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So far are we fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> graunting your <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> as here you fancy with your ſelf.</p>

Howſoever, ſeeing you confeſſe that you erre, why do you and the reſt being ſo perſwaded ſtil abide in error? Is it becauſe you<note n="†" place="margin">Ioh. 3.19.</note> love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes more then light? Or becauſe<note n="‡" place="margin">Act. 28.26 27.</note> when you ſee, yet you wink with your eyes, leaſt you ſhould convert to the Lord, and be healed? If you would not leaue ſuch as you imagine ſee it not: how wil you ever know whether they that refuſe, do ſee it, or not? And why have you not al this time made it knowen to them, and donne what lyeth in you to draw them from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror? Or having done it, and finding them obſtinate in evill, yea perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the truth revealed: why have you not (after the<note n="‡" place="margin">Act. 2.40.41. &amp; 13.45.46.51. &amp; 18.6. and 19.9. &amp; 28.24. &amp;c.</note> example of the Apoſtles) ſeparated from ſuch and taught others to do the like? Above all, why plead you for their eſtate to be good, warrantable, in the way of ſalvation, notwithſtanding their errors and abominations? Is not this to dawbe with vntempered morter? Is it not to propheſie peace to the wicked, and to promiſe them life? to ſow pillowes vnder their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes, and to ſtrengthen their hands in evill, that they ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from their wicked way? <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.16.17. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 13. <hi>Chap.

                     <p>Where you ſay, <hi>if we knew ſome convicted in conſcience, yet it ſerueth not our turne, vnles all be ſo conuicted:</hi> ſure you mind not what you ſpeak. Did Chriſt ever give ſuch a rule to his Church? Or ſhould there ever be Church ſeparated from the world, if this courſe were kept? Beſides, what meane you by <hi>all</hi> being convicted? Whether all in a houſe, or all in a towne, or all in a kingdome, or all in the world? Whether all of ech<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſer, men and women; of all ages, yong and old; of all eſtates, hy and low, rich and poore, bond and free, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What alſo by being <hi>convicted?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when ſufficient is ſhowed to convince men, though they ſee it not? or when they ſee it, yet acknowledg it not? or when they ſee and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg it, yet notwithſtanding perſiſt in their former eſtate? or if vnto all theſe they adde the perſecuting alſo of ſuch as do convince them?</p>
                     <p>Now when you have ſhowed, how your ſelf vnderſtand, and how we are to walke in theſe, according to the Scriptures, from point to point:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:177485:36"/>
then applie herevnto your example of <hi>Chriſt</hi> here alledged, and ſee if you do not abuſe it. Mind withall, that if you ſay, <hi>Chriſt knew this as he was God,</hi> you ſpeak nothing to the queſtion, which is how men muſt walk toward men. If you ſay, <hi>he knew it as he vvas man,</hi> then muſt you prove, 1. that theſe Iewes were convicted in conſcience that he was the Chriſt, and yet denied and blaſphemed him: 2. that Chriſt knew this as he was man: 3. that ſtill he joyned in ſpirituall communion with them thus convicted: 4. that the eſtate of your Miniſters and people is ſuch as theirs was then, as touching a true Miniſterie and conſtitution of the Church: 5. that the ſame rules and proceeding is to be vſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward your Church and members thereof (afore they can be ſeparated from) that was to be vſed toward that Church and People at that time.</p>
                     <p>Mind alſo, that the Apoſtles preaching to the Iewes, though they knew not who were <hi>convicted in conſcience,</hi> who not: yet<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 2. et 13. et 17. et 18. et 19. chap</note> vpon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall of the truth offred, did ſeparate from all where they were. And ſo Chriſt before had required them to do. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.14.</p>
                     <p>Finally mind, that <hi>mens conſciences</hi> are blind, ignorant, corrupt, and the <hi>heart of man</hi> deceitful and wicked above all things. Who can know it, but the Lord only which ſearcheth the heart and trieth the reines, to give every man according to his waies, according to the fruit of his works? <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.9.10.</p>
                     <p>It is erroneous therefore (to hold as you do) that we may not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, till we know <hi>all to be convicted in their conſcience.</hi> If this were to be done, then neither ſeparation from any people, neither any true Churches ſhould ever be vpon the earth: becauſe ſuch conviction can never be either knowen of men, or had in the world. It doth and muſt ſuffice vs, that the truth on the one hand, and the errors on the other be made knowen and convicted, that is, be layd open and proved from the word of God, by the teſtimonie of his ſervants: and that we ſee men by words or workes refuſe the truth and imbrace error, and ſo judg them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves vnworthy of euerlaſting life.</p>
                     <p>Thus for your Churches <hi>(M. Iacob)</hi> it ſufficeth vs, that in your Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, Leiturgy, and confuſion of people, they be proved the daughters of <hi>Babylon</hi> that mother of whoredomes. Out of which God hath<note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 18.4. &amp; 17.5. vve <hi>Ezec.</hi> 16.44.</note> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>all his people</hi> (without exception or delay) preſently for to depart. If you or any other will not obey this commaundement of God, but will ſtill partake in the ſinnes of your worſhip and Miniſtery: what is it to vs? We muſt follow Chriſt,<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 5.9.</note> who is made author of ſaluation to ſuch onely as obey him. Neither may we<note n="†" place="margin">Ier. 15.19.</note> returne vnto you, but we muſt waite till God bring you to vs, and make you partakers of the ſame grace in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Of your third generall point (here idly mentioned and abſurdly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered) I have ſpoken before. <hi>Pag.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>Next inſtead of aunſwering, you fall a marveling: becauſe I ſay, <hi>Mr.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:177485:37"/>
Hus and other of the holy Martyrs did heare and ſay Maſſe to their dying day, and ſome of them alſo acknowledg the Popes ſupremacy.</hi> But why do you not alſo marvell, that I ſayd divers of them acknowledged, <hi>ſome the Popes calling, ſome</hi> 7 <hi>Sacraments, ſome Purgatory, ſome Auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar confeſſion, and ſuch like grieuous errors?</hi> For theſe I ioyned with the other, and of them you ſpeak not a word. Belike you thinke they may ſtand with the Goſpell wel inough: and if your Church had retained or now ſhould reſume them againe, you would judg of them as of the other corruptions remaining among you.</p>
                     <p>Yet mind withall, 1. that thus you make a way for mo popiſh enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities to be mainteined and to prevaile apace in your Church, as<note n="“" place="margin">Hovv ſay you to thoſe Popiſh doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines novv ſpreading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, of Chriſtes ſoule deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>Now for your <hi>marvelling at me</hi> for ſaying thus of <hi>Mr. Hus</hi> and other the <hi>Martyrs:</hi> I aſke you, Saith not the book of Acts and Monuments the ſame? yea, ſay not the Martyrs thus much of themſelves? Why do you not then marvell alſo at them? For theſe particulars it were needles to go through all the hiſtorie of the Martyrs: ſpecially ſeeing they are ſo plainly noted in their ſtories, and every where among you the books are in your hands. Yet becauſe <hi>Mr. Hus</hi> is here ſpoken of by name, and you are not far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> raſing him out of the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs: I will firſt note ſome particulars concerning him, and then cleare him and the reſt from your raſh condemnation.</p>
                     <p>In the hiſtorie of the Martyrs before mentioned, we find that <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> vnto his death held, 1.<note n="†" place="margin">Act. and Monu. edit. 5. pag. 561.</note> ſeven Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; 2.<note n="‡" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 581. a. 584. b</note> the Popes office, and the authority of the Church of Rome; 3.<note n="“" place="margin">Ibid. p. 566 b. et 574.</note> Auricular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion to Prieſts, and was himſelf (a little before his death) confeſſed and abſolved by a Monke; 4.<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid. p. 577 a. et 581. a.</note> ſaid Maſſe himſelf; 5.<note n="†" place="margin">Ibid. p. 546</note> held that the ſubſtance of the bread was altered into the body of Chriſt, and that Chriſts body which was borne of the virgin Mary, is really and totally in the Sacrament of the Altar; with other the like popiſh opinions. Now you (Mr. Iacob) ſticke not vpon ſome of theſe to inferre, <hi>that then ſurely neither Hus nor any of the reſt that ſo held and did, vvere holy Martyrs.</hi> Your reaſon is, <hi>becauſe therein are found errors plainely fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall vvhich of them ſelues aboliſh from Chriſt.</hi> Among which no doubt but you reckon the <hi>Maſſe</hi> and <hi>tranſubſtantiation</hi> ſpecially.</p>
                     <p>Thus haue you cleane put out <hi>Maiſter Hus</hi> and other the ſervants of Chriſt (faithfull in that which they ſaw) from being any longer in the Catalogue of the Martyrs, or accounted true Chriſtians. May I not then iuſtly returne vpon your ſelf your owne ſaying, <hi>Is this you that vvhite the toombes of the Martyrs, and yet in fine condemne them for no true Chriſtians, for no holy Martyrs?</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides this bold vntruth of yours, let the Reader mind, how plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you inſinuate, that if your Church had <hi>the Maſſe and the Popes ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> ſo it were not in the <hi>largeſt and groſſeſt ſort,</hi> you could defend their caſe aſwell then as you do now, by bearing the world in hand, <hi>that theſe things might ſtand vvith Chriſt crucified, &amp;c.</hi> Let the Reader mind and remember it. I ſay no more.</p>
                     <p>It remaineth that now I cleare <hi>M. Hus</hi> and the reſt of the Martyrs from your raſh cenſure. You judge, <hi>if any of them held any errors that be fundamentall, they are no holy Martyrs, but aboliſhed from Chriſt.</hi> This I denie. And you to proue it, ſhould from the Scriptures have ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt, what it is to be <hi>fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall</hi> or of the <hi>foundation:</hi> then, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever holdeth ſuch error is <hi>aboliſhed from Chriſt.</hi> But you have done neither. I know that here and everie where you give vs your bare word, and obtrude vnto vs your owne fancies. But your words are no Oracles, nor your fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies rules for any to follow. Handle theſe things therefore more ſoundly in your next. And what you ſpeak, ſpeak it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word of God. In the meane time for better clearing of the truth and Martyrs, I will ſhow you my mind: being ready notwithſtanding to heare any that can ſhow better from the word of God. And ſo I pray you take this and all my writings.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the word <hi>foundation</hi> is vſed in the ſcripture, and therefore is of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:177485:38"/>
vs to be conſidered divers waies. One is, in reſpect of God and his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection;<note place="margin">Of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and fundamental points.</note> or of his Church and people called and ſanctified in Chriſt. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. <hi>Pro.</hi> 10.25. Another is, in reſpect of the onely ground of all true faith and Churches, which is Ieſus Chriſt; or of the firſt principles and ſpeciall heads of Chriſtian religion. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.15.16.17.18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 26.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.2. A third is, in reſpect of the Apoſtles and Prophets doctrine concerning Chriſt; or of our receiving it and building therevpon. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10-15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7.8. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.48.49.</p>
                     <p>Now which way ſoever you take it, there is no queſtion but the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, although they erred (through ignorance of that time) in ſome waightie points of Chriſts Religion (which you call <hi>fundamentall</hi>) yet were notwithſtanding holy Martyrs. For touching the firſt of the exceptions aforeſaid, <hi>Gods foundation</hi> remained ſure and ſealed vnto them; ſo as the Lord knew them to be his, and they alſo were ſanctified both to witnes vnto death the truth then called in queſtion, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the contrarie iniquitie. Touching the ſecond and third, they both beleeved in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> as it pleaſed God to reveale him in their age by the <hi>doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles;</hi> and they <hi>built firmely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon</hi> (not ſtumbling at the word and diſobeying it, as is the manner of moſt now a daies, but) obeying and holding it forth vnto death. So as when the ſtormes and floods of perſecution beat vpon them, they were not ſhaken from the truth they teſtified, but remained conſtant to the end: even when the politick Statutes of Princes; the ſubtill argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the learned; the earneſt perſwaſion of their friends; the great loſſe of their goods, liberty, eſtimation in the world; finally the moſt cruell vſage and tirannie of the Adverſaries; as it were ſo many waves and tempeſts, ſtronglie aſſailed to drive them a contrarie courſe. Thus were they faithfull to God, and loved not their lives vnto death as their <hi>Martyrdome</hi> proclaimeth to all the world: howſoever you could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent it ſeemeth (for any the more advantage to your ſelves) to lay their honour in the duſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly in this queſtion we are to diſcerne, betweeen the <hi>errors</hi> them ſelves, and between the <hi>perſons</hi> that hold them. The errours may in their nature be <hi>fundamentall</hi> (as you ſpeak:) and yet the perſons erring therein (of ignorance, not ſtriving againſt the light revealed, but inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring to walk faithfully in the truth they ſee) may through Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in Chriſt be ſaved. For example, ſome of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.12</note>

                        <hi>Circumciſion &amp; the Law,</hi> although the errors were in their owne nature <hi>fundamentall</hi> (as you will not deme,) yet might they that dyed in them, before Paules epiſtles came to thoſe Churches thereabout, be ſaved of God: As we<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.30.31.32.</note> read that ſome were dead and chaſtiſed of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about <hi>their abuſe of the Sacrament,</hi> yet not condemned with the world.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe of <hi>Abijah</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> that made Iſraell to ſinne,

                     <p>Furthermore at this day, concerning the errors of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſubſtantiation and the perſon of Chriſt; of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> about Chriſts humanitie, and denying Baptiſme to the ſeed of the faithfull; of the <hi>Papiſtes</hi> about tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſubſtantiation, the Popes ſupremacie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that you will graunt both that theſe errors be fundamentall (as touching the nature of the errors the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves) and that yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding God ſaveth ſome Luthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Anabaptiſts, Papiſts, erring in the points aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>If you denie it, let vs have a ſound aunſwer to that profeſſion of the Papiſts touching Chriſts Mediation, which by themſelves is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their Annotations vpon the new Teſtament: where they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that they hold<note n="*" place="margin">Rhem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <hi>I thank God, I am none of your Church.</hi> And this was the caſe of them al, being likewiſe dealt with, as that book wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth.</p>
                     <p>Your Exception, <hi>that Mr. Cranmer and Mr. Ridley ſtood vpon their right to their Biſhopricks,</hi> is of no waight againſt that I ſayd. It is not vnknowen, that men do often ſtand againſt the vniuſt dealing of their adverſaries, in ſuch things as notwithſtanding they are willing inough to leave. Whether it were ſo or not with them, God knoweth. Of this I am ſure, that where I ſpake of their <hi>not hauing,</hi> you do in your Reply in ſteed thereof ſpeak of <hi>renouncing.</hi> And ſo you change my ſpeach: Which is not good (though it be your vſuall) dealing. But yet by this appeareth that you can prove no vntruth in my ſpeach, howſoever you pretend and would gladly do it. For if you could, what needed you ſo alter and pervert the ſence of my wordes? And for my ſelf, if I had meant that Mr. Cranmer and Mr. Ridley had <hi>renounced</hi> (as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend)
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:177485:39"/>
I could have joyned them with others in the ſentence going before where I ſpake of Mr. Latimers <hi>forſaking</hi> his Prelacy: which your ſelf do here confeſſe to be true. Beſides, I ſpake of the time when they <hi>dyed</hi> Martyrs, you of the time before that.</p>
                     <p>But now what will you ſay to <hi>Mr. Ridley,</hi> who (as the<note n="*" place="margin">Act. and Mon. edit. 5. p. 1604. a.</note> ſtorie witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth) at his degradation being bid to put on the ſurplus, <hi>refuſed to do it:</hi> and when they did put it vpon him with<note n="“" place="margin">This vvas, becauſe he had ben a popiſh prieſt</note> al the trinckets appertaining to the Maſſe, <hi>did vehemently inv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet I denie not, but even then he might be ignorant of the vnlawfulnes of the Prelacy, as ſince that time God hath revealed it by his word: and by that meanes (it may be) did like and ſtand for it more, then otherwiſe he either ought or would have done.</p>
                     <p>But you ſay, <hi>whoſoever were Miniſters then of the Prelates ordination, they never renounced it, though they dyed Maryrs.</hi> If this were true and of waight, you might by the ſame reaſon as well plead for the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Prieſts</hi> at this day as for your owne. You know that very many of the Martyrs were popiſh Prieſts. And if there were no other proof, even their degradation from that Prieſthood doth teſtifie it. You might alſo thus plead for retaining and allowing of <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Fryars,</hi> becauſe ſome of them have died Martyrs, and yet not renounced their callings and functions. This I alledged<note n="‡" place="margin">In the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver to your 1.

                     <p>Yet now for that you ſpeak here, what will you ſay to<note n="†" place="margin">Act. and Mon. edit. 5. p. 934. a.</note> ſuch as being degraded of their Miniſterie received from the Prelates, <hi>thanked God that they were delivered from the maligna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Church of Antichriſt.</hi> Did they not by this and ſuch like ſpeach and cariage, noted in their ſtories, declare how willingly they left both that Church, Miniſtery, worſhip, and whatſoever belonged thereto? Although through ignorance of the time they ſaw not ſome things, wherein ſince their daies God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a greater light.</p>
                     <p>To end this point then, howſoever it be for their <hi>renouncing,</hi> certaine it is (as their ſtories ſhow) that ſuch of them as had receved Miniſterie from the Prelates, were before their death not only excommunicate (as were the reſt of the Martyrs) but degraded alſo from the functions and Miniſterie they had received. So as it cannot but be, as I ſaid, <hi>that when they dyed Martyrs they neither had nor ioyned with the Prelacy and Miniſtery now pleaded for.</hi> See the<note n="*" place="margin">Act. and Mon. edit. 5. p. 895. b. 934. a. 1361. b. 1385. a. 1604. a.</note> ſtorie in the degrading of <hi>Richard Bayfield, Henry Foreſt, Mr. Saunders, Mr. Tailor, Mr. Ridley, &amp;c.</hi> Thus the bold vntruth wherewith you charge me falſly, is returned iuſtly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your owne head.</p>
                     <p>Next after this which was in the <hi>beginning</hi> of my defence (as your ſelf have noted) you come to the <hi>ſixt point of my aunſvver,</hi> paſſing by the

other things which come between. Is this to reply ſoundly? Is this your worthy Confutation which your followers judge vnaunſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? What (I pray) may be the cauſe why you ſnatch thus here a peece and there a peece, and proſecute not my aunſwer in order from point to point, as I gave it? Is it becauſe I handle things diſorderly, or paſſe by any thing in your Reply vnaunſwered? If I do, ſhow it. But in deed, is it not becauſe you are not able to reply againſt my aunſwer, as it is given: and therefore are glad to lay hold, ſometimes of one thing, ſometimes of another, as you think you can beſt deale with; that ſo you may trouble the Reader, and ſeeme to ſay ſome thing, when in deed you ſay nothing at all? Let the Reader but well mind this Reply of yours, and then judge if ever he ſaw anie thing more raw, frivolous, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, abſurd. Yet ſuch as it is, let vs ſee now what you ſay to that point of my aunſwer whereof you ſpeake next.</p>
                     <p>Firſt you tell vs, that where you ſaid before, <hi>the outward orders of the Church be not of the foundation ſimply, you meant, not at all of the verie foundation.</hi> I ſee your meaning now Mr. Iacob, which before I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did nor could. Sure you had need make a Commentarie vpon your Replie, if you expound your words euerie where, as you do here. But now that you have told vs your meaning, will you ſtand vnto it? Do you indeed by <hi>not ſimply</hi> meane <hi>not at all?</hi> Then marke what ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g aſſertions lurke in your writing, which before we could not perceiue.

Yet you are bold to bleſſe your ſelf, your whole Church, and greateſt perſecuters,

in all theſe miſchiefs: affirming that thus to beleev and practiſe, deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>not at all</hi> any mans ſalvation in Chriſt.

Yet it were better Mr. Iacob, if in time you were grieved at your ſelf, for vſing ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly eluſions to turne away the truth.

                     <p>But let vs come to examine the point it ſelf.

How ſay you? Do not theſe concerne the outward orders of the Church? And doth not the Apoſtle reckon them with the reſt there named in his laying of the <hi>foundation?</hi> I could alſo put you in mind, how it concerneth the Churches outward governeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>vvhether the Pope be head of the church</hi> or Chriſt only: whether <hi>Circumciſion</hi> be now to be obſerved, or not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe and the like I have mentioned before, and you I ſuppoſe will aunſwer them at leaſure.</p>

And when you have told vs this, then know for your learning (beſides that alreadie ſpoken touching the foundation) that the <hi>outvvard orders,</hi> that is, the outward ordinances, ceremonies, and gouernement, which God preſcribed to the Iewes, were vnto them ſo of the <hi>foundation</hi> and neceſſarie to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as<note n="‡" place="margin">Deut. 27.26.</note> curſe and death was threatned to all that brake them. Yea, ſevere puniſhment even vnto death was executed vpon the tranſgreſſors of ſuch things as ſeemed but ſmall: <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.1.2. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.19. <hi>and</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.6.7. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.16.19. Now theſe things are written for our inſtruction, to admoniſh vs vpon whome the ends of the world are come. If yet notwithſtanding you and your Church will preſume o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, be it at your perill. Our ſoules ſhall not enter into your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</p>
                     <p>The third queſtion here was about <hi>Corah and his complices.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in you deale as with the former, not keping mine owne words. It may be you thought by this meanes to hide the vanity of your au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwer. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, al the aunſwer you give to the ſeverall branches of it, is only this, that they were ſeparated from and damned, <hi>not that the matter vvas fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, but that the manner vvas rebellious, vvith conſciences a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d times convicted, and ſo done vvith an high hand againſt God himſelf.</hi> But how prove you this which you ſay? And why aunſwer you not to the ſeverall points of the queſtion, in order as they were propounded? It may be you will do this in your next. Then in the meane time know that even the <hi>matter</hi> wherein they ſinned was <hi>fundamentall,</hi> if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it thus: Their ſinne was, that not being Prieſts they would <hi>offer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe</hi> to God. Now the Priehſtood and offering vp of incenſe led them as it were by the hand to the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> and <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of Chriſt. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:177485:41"/>
therefore, you muſt denie Chriſts Prieſthood and Interceſſion to be of the foundation, or els you muſt graunt they ſinned in a matter in this reſpect fundamentall, that is, being thus conſidered. Yet it was (you ſee) touching the Prieſthood and Minjſterie, which concerne <hi>the outward orders and governement of the Church.</hi> Thus al your defence falleth to the ground.</p>
                     <p>Touching the <hi>manner</hi> alſo, Corah and his complices had pretence for them ſelves aſwell as your Prelates and Prieſts now have. Read and mind well what great reaſons they pretend, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.<note place="margin">Num. 16.2.3</note> And ſee if you can ſhew any greater, yea or any the like for your ſelves. Then ſpeak, whether that conſidered, it be not as hard for you to affirme them ſo convicted in conſcience, as for vs to affirme it of you in England. And now that I mind it, let me aſke of you (Mr. Iacob) in this caſe, as you<note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 36.</note> erewhile did of me in your owne. <hi>Did their whole aſſemblies ſinne thus? all and every of their aſſemblies? of wilfulnes and of a convicted conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? Are you ſure of this? Do you know every mans hart and conſcience ſo vvel? If you do, then you ſay ſomevvhat indeed. But you are then neere as vviſe as God himſelfe, to knovv mens hearts ſo perfectly, vvhoſe faces you never ſavv. &amp;c.</hi> How like you now your owne manner of reaſoning? Is it not verie proper think you, and to great purpoſe?</p>
                     <p>But perhaps you will ſay, the Scripture ſpeakes aſmuch as you do concerning them. If it do, why ſhew you not the places? Why prove you it not from thence? Nay then, what ſay you Mr. Iacob, to the <hi>litle children</hi> which periſhed in that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation, as the<note n="*" place="margin">Num. 16.27.32.</note> Scripture there witneſſeth? Will you ſay that they in that action were ſo rebellious (as you ſpeake of) with conſciences a thouſand times convicted? Or will you now confeſſe your Reply to be of no waight at all, ſave againſt your ſelf?</p>
                     <p>To which end I wiſh both your ſelf and the Reader to note (for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion) that here you graunt, even for <hi>outvvard orders of the Church,</hi> when men ſee the truth in their conſciences and yet ſtand againſt it, the eſtate of ſuch to be damnable. It is high time then for you M. Iacob and for D. B. who made the preface to your book, and for all ſuch whoſe conſciences are convicted of the Antichriſtianitie of your Prelates and the reſt of your abominations (as divers times in this book your ſelf accknowledge:) it is high time, I ſay, for you and all ſuch to be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Corahs</hi> deſtruction. And we now have as good warrant (by your owne graunt) to ſeparate from you and all ſuch, as the Iſraelites had from <hi>Corah</hi> and his companie. Except peradventure you thinke the Miniſterie and ordinances of Chriſt to be of leſſe moment then thoſe of Moſes, or Chriſt the Sonne to be worthy leſſe honour then Moſes the ſervant. But ſee more yet hereof in the 6. Reaſon following.</p>
                     <p>After this you turne back to ſomewhat handled in the entrance of this Exception. Thus you runne in and out, a man cannot tell where to have you. For the point you ſpeak of I leave it to the Reader to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:177485:42"/>
iudge, comparing your writing and mine togeather, whether I have not iuſtly charged you, <hi>for going about to iuſtifie your eſtate by the example of Cranmer, Ridley, &amp;c.</hi> Now I am glad to ſee you acknowledge the matters controverted betweene vs to be your <hi>errours.</hi> For by this it followeth, that you ſee the contrarie truth, which diſcovereth theſe to be errours. And then your ſelf (I truſt) will not denie but that you are bound vtterlie to forſake theſe, and to walke in the truth revealed vnto you: vnles you had rather erre with Antichriſt to deſtruction, then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt to ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>But you truſt it is ſound, <hi>to iuſtifie by the example of the Martyrs, that theſe corruptions aboliſh not you from Chriſt, as theirs did not them.</hi> Nay Mr. Iacob, it is very vnſound for you or any the like to reaſon thus. For beſides the many differences betwene you and the Martyrs alreadie declared: tell me your ſelf, if the Huſſites (ſo called) ſhould at this day reaſon after this manner, <hi>viz. Although we retaine the Maſſe, tranſubſtantiation, ſeven Sacraments, Auricular confeſſion, and ſuch like, yet theſe corruptions aboliſh vs not from Chriſt, any more then they did Iohn Hus and the other Martyrs that held and vſed them:</hi> If (I ſay) they ſhould now reaſon thus for themſelves, would not your ſelf ſay, their reaſon were vnſound?</p>
                     <p>But further, if the Martyrs you ſpeak of had ſeen theſe things to be <hi>errors,</hi> and continewed in them, purſued thoſe that reproved them, and againſt the knowen truth ſought to have dawbed vp their erroneous building, as you Mr. Iacob and the like among you do at this day: we could not then have ſo eſteemed them as now we do. This therefore will help you nothing at all. We have better hope in this reſpect of ſuch in England, as to this day have not diſcerned the Antichriſtian a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations among you, then of you and the like ſtrugling Phariſees: for whome we feare it will be harder in the day of iudgment, then for them.</p>

And this laſt you have publiſhed in your printed book as if it had ben in your written coppie which I aunſwered: where it was not at all. The abuſe is great not to me only, but to the Reader: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as theſe things were by you ſo publiſhed, as if your <hi>laſt compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon</hi> neither were nor could be aunſwered. Let the Reader note this maner of dealing for ſuch as it is.</p>
                     <p>The ſimilitude now added to the reſt, is this: <hi>My brother hath an eye of glaſſe, or he hath a woodden legge, therefore my brother is no true man.</hi> I aunſwer, that after your woonted maner you take for graunted that which you ſhould prove: <hi>viz,</hi> that your Church in that conſtitution is as a man with an eye of glaſſe or woodden legge.

aunſvvered as the laſt Exception before. The Svvanne is blacke of his bill, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Svvan is blacke, and my brother hath a vvodden legge: Therefore my brother is a vvodden man.

                     <p>Furthermore, the Scriptures alleadged 2 Cor. 6.

YOur anſwer is firſt concerning the Propoſition, then concerning the Aſſumption. For the Propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſay, the ſpeach is vnproper that <hi>Chriſt &amp; Antichriſt is among you ioyned togeather.</hi> Then you take vpon you to expound our meaning to be thus, <hi>Chriſt and ſome outvvard ceremonies and orders of Antichriſt.</hi> To this we anſwer, Firſt, that the ſpeach is fit and proper: Secondly, that it is meete that we (not you) expound our owne meaning: Which togeather with the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the ſpeach, will now appear in that which followeth.</p>

                        <label>H. Iacob his 2. Reply vnto the 1. Reaſon.</label>
IN this your defence of your firſt Reaſon, <hi>you would firſt of all faſten on me a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, for graunting, that our Church corruptions are from Antichriſt, which againſt your Second Exception,</hi> I <hi>ſayd we holde to be Chriſtes owne, viz. Becauſe we hold, Chriſt hath giuen his Church that libertie to deuiſe them.</hi> Alas it pittieth me to ſee your ſimplicity, or it greeueth me for your malice; vvho could not ſee, that there<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>See Pag.</hi> 28. 35.</note> I ſpake in the perſon of our vvhole Church and ſtate, and ſhevved vvhat they held: And here I ſpeak as I thought my ſelfe. This is a ſilly contradiction.</p>
                     <p>Then you ſay, Pag. 62. <hi>I dazell the peoples eyes, in ſaying ſome outward orders and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are from Antichriſt as if they were but few and of ſmall moment.</hi> Therefore you are content to recken them vp full tediouſly God knovveth euen 91. in number: <hi>numero Deus impare gaudet.</hi> And vvhat of all theſe? vvill you ſay therefore, that vvhoſoeuer holdeth theſe, cannot hold Chriſt vnto ſaluation. And ſo Mr. <hi>Cranmer</hi> and the reſt of the Martyrs vvere damned. But if not: Then I ſay againe, Theſe ſome, theſe 91. are too few and too ſlight, and of too ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of themſelues and of their owne nature to aboliſh vs from Chriſt. This ought you to haue proved, which you never do, but ſtill your ſpeach is moſt falſe, and not vnproper onely, <hi>that we ioyne Christ and Antichrist togeather:</hi> As in the maimed man before<note n="‡" place="margin">
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 57. 62.</note> noted, there is not life and death ioyned togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but living things and dead things are, and yet the man aliue and a true man.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>you will iuſtifie your applying the</hi>
                        <note n="‡" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 6.14. <hi>&amp;c. Eze.</hi> 43.8. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.33.34.40.41</note> 
                        <hi>Scriptures</hi> which I ſayd were miſmatched and were meant againſt the Idolatry of the Firſt commandement, not againſt the Idolatry of the Second onely, and meerlye, as our Church orders in queſtion are. Therefore theſe Scriptures cannot inferre any abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing from Chriſt by ſimple holding of the corruptions in our Church:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:177485:50"/>
vvhich they doe proue by the ſimple holding of thoſe Heatheniſh Idolatries, vvhereof they ſpeake. To this you reply in Foure points. (1) <hi>If theſe places bee meant of Heatheniſh Idolatrie, which could never ſtand with Gods truth togeather: Yet they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all other corruptions against the Second commaundement alſo.</hi> That I neuer denied to be true after a ſort. Theſe places indeede do forbid the breach of the Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d commaundement, but not principally, directly and of purpoſe, nor in that meaſure of fulnes. But their immediate purpoſe is againſt the Heatheniſh Idolatry breaking the Firſt commaundement. So that they forbidde the breach of the Second commaundement, conſequently and proportionately, but not in that full manner as they doe the Firſt, They forbid the Firſt ſo as that they ſhew there is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion vvith God, vvhilſt men ioyne in ſuch Idolatry: they ſimply forbid the Second, but deny not all communion vvith God to vvhome ſoever erreth therein.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) To your Second Reply I ſay, make much of it: for my parte, I neuer thought other but our church corruptions are againſt the Second commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.</note> Your ſecond Scripture here applyed, is of <hi>Saull,</hi> a preſumptuous and vvilfull offendour: if you make our vvhole Churches ſo, your ſinne is the greater.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3) Thirdly, if you meane, any of Antichriſts Idolatrie and falſe vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and namely this in queſtion (the outward corrupt orders and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies onely and no more) doth aboliſh vs from Chriſt, and that this can not ſtand togeather with true faith, like as the Pagans idolatrie againſt the Firſt commaundement, cannot. Then I deny it vtterly, you haue no proofe in the world for it. And this inwrappeth Maiſter <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, &amp;c.</hi> in the ſame courſe. Your excuſe here in Pag. 67. <hi>That Cranmer, Ridley, &amp;c. forſooke all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions they ſaw.</hi> This belongeth to many Thouſands in England now, no leſſe then to them: Yea ſurely there are infinite, that know not ſo much of the corruptions, as thoſe learned men did, which yet are not ignoraunt of rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt, &amp;c. Yea your ſelf Maiſter <hi>Iohnſon,</hi> though a man of learning, yea knowing our corruptions, and miſliking them a long time before you forſooke vs, yet I think you ſtood not aboliſhed from Chriſt all that while. I pray be ſo good to poore men as you may: yea to vs now alſo, aſwel as to your ſelf and them in thoſe times. Where you ſay in Pag. 67. <hi>That ſince that time we are convicted by the Scriptures.</hi> If you meane ſome fevve, that here and there you could pick out, and do ſinne ſtill, ſpeake to them, threaten them: throvv out your damnatory ſentence againſt them, But ſmite not all whoſoever comes neare you: Beware how you iudge, leaſt you be iudged: The heart belongeth to God, therefore cenſure not every mans conſcience too haſtily.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4) Fourthly, you vvould prove in your Third Exception before noted, Pag. 67. <hi>That both the breach of the firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundment, and of the Second alſo, is forbidden:</hi> I have told you before, Pag. 69. 70. hovv it is true, and hovv not: Nothing at all to ſerue your turne.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14.</note> That vvhich you ſay, Pag. 67. touching your firſt Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 2 Cor. 6.14. &amp;c. in that ſence and manner as I ſayd, it is true, and not othervviſe.</p>
                     <p>That vvhich of your Second Scripture (Ezek. 43.8.) Pag. Ibid. you ſay,

                        </note> I ſay it is moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that he ſpeaketh not of the breach of the Second co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandment onely, but alſo of the firſt, wherin men haue their inventio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s alſo. The Prophet ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth verſ. 4. and 7. That God returned to his Temple againe, vvhence he vvas departed for the abominable idolatries that had ben there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted before, to ſhevv that he vvould reſtore Ieruſalem, and the Temple, and vvorſhip of God againe: He meaneth this literally, of the returning of the <hi>Iewes</hi> after <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons captiuity,</hi> and of the reedifying of the Temple, and the appointing againe of Gods holy vvorſhip there: Alſo ſpiritually he may meane, the erecting of the Chriſtian Church vvhen they ſhould not fall to ſuch impieties as the Ievves had done novv in that time before, for the vvhich he had departed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them. Nowe if we aſke, what were thoſe Idolatours in Ieruſalem and in the Temple before Ezekiels time, for the whiche the Lord forſooke them: it is manifeſt in <hi>Ahas,</hi> in <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Amon:</hi> and in the Kings after <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> That the <hi>Iewes</hi> idolatrie was verie Heatheniſh, not onely againſt the Second, but againſt the Firſt commandment alſo, in ioyning the Heathen gods with the true God of Iſraell in their Diuine ſeruice and Worſhip: Therefore this place of Ezekiell, is (as I ſay) not of the breach of the Second commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment onely &amp; ſimplie, as our church corruptions are, but ioinctlie touching the breach of the Firſt alſo.</p>
                     <p>The very ſame is that your third ſcripture pag. 67. 2 Kings 17.33.34.40.41. of the Samaritans Idolatrie, wherein becauſe you are large,<note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.</note> I vvill deferre to explaine it till your Sixt Reaſon follovving: vvhere is a proper place for it.</p>
                     <p>Laſtlie, in pag. 68. <hi>you agrauate the breach of the Second Commandment: as being ſpirituall whordome, &amp;c.</hi> But I would haue you to knovv: Things may be miſmatched to cruelly, aſvvell as too gently. There is a ſinne both vvayes, vvhen things are not called by their proper and right names. It is true in ſome ſence, euery breach of the Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandment, is ſpiritual vvhordome, as euery vvanton vvord, euery light geſture &amp; countenance, euery immodeſt thought in a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, is Adulterie: yet vvho ſo ſhall angerlie &amp; continuallie ſo call a Woman vvhore, harlot, or bande, that but thinketh, or looketh, or ſpeaketh too vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhall doe her great vvrong, &amp; incurre the iuſt dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of lavv.

                     <p>In the ende in pag. 69. vvhere you ſay, <hi>To the proofe of your Aſſumption I anſwere never a word, which moſt of all required anſwere.</hi> This I tell you, that it is your fancie and not my meaning heere, to anſvver to your Propoſition firſt, and then to your Aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſay nothing.

IN deed you are the people that haue ſkill, and wiſdome muſt dy with you. Yet let vs a litle examine this your wiſe handling of the matter. Being taken here with manifeſt contradiction, you ſay, <hi>you ſpake the one in the perſon of your whole Church and State, the other in your owne.</hi> If it were ſo, yet thus you yeeld both that there is contradiction in your ſpeach, and that in ſtead of defending your Church you are driuen your ſelf to contradict it.

                     <p>Further, it is here to be noted, how playnely you affirme theſe two things agayne, 1. <hi>That your Church-corruptions are from Antichriſt:</hi> 2. <hi>That yet your Church holds them to be Chriſts owne.</hi> A moſt ſilly, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and godles defence of a Church, as ever was ſeen.</p>

Heretofore when you preached againſt them, and ſued to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to haue them remoued, it was a pleaſure to you and all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, to name them, to print them, to make your pulpits ring of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and every where to cry out againſt them as moſt filthy and abominable.

                     <p>Now where you ſay, <hi>there are infinite of your Church that know not ſo much of the corruptions, as thoſe learned men did, which yet are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of redemption by Chriſt &amp;c.</hi> How ſhew you this to be true? Although if it be, it is no great commendation to your Church, conſidering what meanes of further knowledg God hath vouchſafed ſince that tyme. But of this point I will not ſtand ſo much. I aunſwer, that to make your compariſon hold, you muſt compare with thoſe learned men, the learned among you; and with the vnlearned then, the vnlearned of yours now. So ſhall your ſelf and others ſee how vntrue your ſpeach is. Although I doubt not but even many of the <hi>vnlearned</hi> among you who have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of redemption by Chriſt, know alſo more of the corruptions afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, then thoſe learned men did.

                     <p>The ſecond thing you except againſt concerning the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> is that I ſaid, <hi>the things now controverted were not then ſo called in queſtion and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

If it were but ſo, yet then the thing is done more ſynce, then in thoſe daies.</p>
                     <p>But in deed the calling in queſtion and conviction of theſe things, hath not ben onely to ſome few, as you would perſwade. The Admonitions have ben to the whole Parliament, which are as the body of the whole Land, and gathered from all the quarters thereof. Your preaching like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe againſt thoſe corruptions hath gone throughout the whole Realme. So have your books written and printed againſt them.

                     <p>The Firſt is directlie towching Gods inward worſhip, as to have, love, truſt, feare him onely as God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is directlie of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip: For <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>bowing downe</hi> to them (<note n="“" place="margin">

                     <p>By this alſo it is evident, that the Idolatrie <hi>of Ahas, Manaſſes, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon &amp;c.</hi> whereof you ſpeak, was directlie againſt the Second co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Ahaz</hi> (to give an inſtance in one of the groſſeſt) is ſaid to have<note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Chro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 28 23.</note>

Scripture ſpeaketh (not as men judge, but) as God eſteemeth. Minde this well <hi>Mr. Iacob,</hi> for your worſhip of Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>But of theſe things more hereafter, when wee come to ſpeak of the third Scripture (2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.) in the ſixt Reaſon following,<note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.</note> whither you refer vs for it: though there the Reader ſhall finde you aunſwer not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Scriptures here alledged for proof of it. In the meane time let this be noted, that here againe you graunt <hi>your Church corruptions are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Second commaundement.</hi> Therefore may none that feare God and will be aſſured to eſcape his wrath, <hi>bow downe</hi> vnto them. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5.6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.9.10. <hi>and</hi> 6.10.11. <hi>and</hi> 28.15.16. <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 106.29.</p>
                     <p>Next, where I ſpeak of your breach of the ſecond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſpirituall whoredome:</hi> you except againſt it, as if I <hi>miſmatched things</hi> otherwiſe then they are in deed. But how can that be, ſeing the Scriptures <note n="‡" place="margin">
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 68.</note> there alledged prove that which I ſaid? Or will you ſay your caſe is not <hi>ſpirituall whoredome,</hi> which God in that commaundement hath ſtraitlie forbidden and ſeverelie threatned to puniſh?</p>
                     <p>This then being ſo, it is your ſelf <hi>Mr Iacob,</hi> that <hi>miſmatch things</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then in deed they are. For your caſe is not as you would pretend by your ſimilitude, <hi>like a wanton word, a light geſture or contenaunce, or an immodeſt thought of a woman.</hi> But I will tell you what it is like: Even as when <hi>a woman</hi> vnfaithfull to her huſband, is found to commit filthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with other men, after whom ſhe goeth a whoring. Now ſuch a one (whatſoever ſmooth ſpeach, countenance, or excuſe ſhe pretend, yet) is in deed <hi>an whore,</hi> and for this cauſe <hi>to be divorced.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That your caſe is ſuch, your going a whoring after Antichriſt (whoſe ordinances, Hierarchie, worſhip, confuſion <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are retained among you) teſtifies to your faces. Fitly therefore do we applie <hi>the Scriptures</hi> againſt you: and your ſelves it is that ſinne againſt the Third commaundement in miſapplying of them, as I ſhewed ſufficientlie in my former anſwer, againſt which you can ſay nothing.</p>
                     <p>To the <hi>proof of the Aſſumption</hi> you yeeld now at length. Neither can I otherwiſe thinke of your aunſwer, ſeing I have proved <hi>my ſpeach to be proper, and the Scriptures fitly alledged:</hi> and, <hi>you refuſe to iuſtify your owne Articles and eſtate.</hi> Yet leaſt you ſhould againe cavill and delude the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I aſke you, Have I not concluded the queſtion in a <hi>Syllogiſme?</hi> Why then do you not aunſwer directlie to ſome part of it? Have I not proved the <hi>Propoſition</hi> by Scripture, and the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> by your owne Writings and practiſe? The <hi>Concluſion</hi> then muſt needs be true, vnles one of the Propoſitions could be diſproved: which you are ſo far from, as you never go about to do it.</p>
                     <p>The marginall note then is <hi>no ſcoffe,</hi> but a iuſt reproof of your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: which in deed deſerveth much more. But I ſpare you: and leave it to others to iudge, whether you do any thing els in all you ſay, but winde in and out, to hide the truth and blinde the Reader, if you could. The <hi>Scriptures</hi> which I alledged for proof of the <hi>Propoſition,</hi> you handle
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:177485:56"/>
as if I had brought them for proof of the <hi>Aſſumption.</hi> Who is it now (think you) that is in a <hi>dreame?</hi> Agayne, your owne <hi>Books, profeſſion, and practiſe,</hi> by which I proved the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> you towch not at all. Nay you ſay plainely, <hi>it is no part of your mynd to iuſtify them.</hi> Whether it be for that you ſee, they can not poſſibly be <hi>iuſtifyed,</hi> or becauſe you want <hi>ſkill</hi> in your ſelf or <hi>charity</hi> towards your Church for the doing of it, let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers inquire. Sure I am that thus you give the cauſe. For this <hi>belongs</hi> directly vnto it, as all may ſee that have any vnderſtanding, and your ſelf (I ſuppoſe) will not deny, when you have called your wits a litle bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter togeather.</p>

                     <p>Of the trueth of the <hi>Propoſition,</hi> none can doubt. And the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is thus proved:</p>
                     <p>That which appointeth and ratifyeth the worſhipping of God by the precepts of Man, that appointeth and ratifyeth the worſhipping of God in vaine. (This Chriſt affirmeth out of Eſay the Prophet, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. <hi>with Eſay.</hi> 29.13.)</p>

                     <p>Therefore the doctrine publiquely profeſſed and practized by law in England, appoincteth and ratifyeth the worſhipping of God in vaine. And conſequently cannot make a particuler man a true Chriſtian, nor the aſſemblies ſo gathered together, true Churches.</p>

Is not this then a worthie and Clerck like anſwer? Have you not (may we thinke) good proof for your preſent eſtate and Church-conſtitution, which thus leave it altogeather without defence, even when it moſt needeth, and as it were, beggeth your help and ſuccor, if you could affoard it any. Yet now having no aunſwer to any part of the Argument, you bid vs note, <hi>that this Scripture (Mat.</hi> 15.) <hi>here alledged; is verifyed of ſuch as were then of the true viſible Church, with whom Chriſt himſelf and his Apoſtles both in Chriſts tyme, and after his death, did ſometyme ioine and communicate.

Wheras contrarilie, the verie doctrine publiquelie profeſſed and practiſed by law in England, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and ratifieth the falſe worſhipping of God by the inventions of men.

TO this your defence of your Second Reaſon, I ſay, you have aunſwer in your laſt Exception, page 57. <hi>You aſke what propoſition I do deny?</hi> I anſwer, I diſtinguiſh your aſſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as being a fallacie called <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. concluding a thing ſimply, from that which is after a ſort, like vnto that Reaſon which I framed againſt you in pag. 57. A man hath a woodden legg, an eye of glaſſe, &amp;c. Therefore he is no true man. <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, &amp;c.</hi> held aſmuch as wee, aftet mens precepts: Ergo they worſhipped in vaine. <hi>Geneva</hi> holdeth her wafer cakes in the Supper, Ergo, <hi>Geneva</hi> worſhippeth God in vaine. Euen ſo your Aſſumption runneth. <hi>Our doctrine</hi> (ſay you Pag. 82.) <hi>appoincteth Gods worſhip by mens precepts.</hi> This is falſe, vnleſſe you meane it <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, after a ſort, not ſimply. For our doctrine appoincteth not all Gods worſhip by mens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, nor the chiefeſt part of it: as the preaching of the Goſpell of life, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and Prayers, &amp;c. So that it concludeth nothing in that ſence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here you play the falſe Sophiſter, not the Chiſtian and conſcionable Diſputer.

                     <p n="1">1. In your Replie to <hi>the firſt point of my Aunſvver</hi> next following, you can not ſaie a word againſt it. Yet will you not yeeld.

                     <p n="2">2. To the <hi>ſecond</hi> you yeeld with ſhame enough: though your follie be ſo great, as you ſee it not. For firſt, you neither do nor can aunſwer (but againſt your ſelves) to that which I aſked concerning Chriſt and his Apoſtles, <hi>vvhether they communicated in thoſe traditions of the Ieevves, or not.</hi> If by your ſilence you conſent that <hi>they did not</hi> (as in deed the truth is) then by their exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple are we alſo bound not to partake in yours. If you ſaie <hi>they did,</hi> then you both blaſpheme Chriſt, making him a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and give the holy Ghoſt the lie, who in<note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.2.13.14.</note> this verie Chapter teſtifies the contrarie. Thus whatſoever you ſhall aunſwer, it maketh againſt you excedinglie. And becauſe you anſwer not, it importeth that you yeeld. So alſo doth that moſt plainlie, which here you ſpeak for your ſelf.</p>
                     <p>You ſaie <hi>you ſeek not to iuſtify your partaking in your traditions &amp;c.</hi> Yes <hi>Mr Iacob,</hi> you ſeek it, but you are aſhamed to profeſſe it. Els why condemne you vs for not partaking therein? I know you will ſay (as is in the Preface of your book) that your minde is, we ſhould partake with you <hi>in your lavvfull things,</hi> not in your traditions. But for ſhame leave this follie. None can ioyne with any of your Churches or Miniſterie, but they muſt needs partake with your Antichriſtian traditions. Shew the contrarie in any Miniſter or Church of the Land, and we yeeld. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, what do you but yeeld?</p>
                     <p>The <hi>renouncing</hi> you ſpeak of, is in word, not in work. You renounce evill with your lippes, but approve it in your deeds. And thus is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified vpon you that which Chriſt out of the Prophet ſpake in the<note n="†" place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>And where you ſpeak of ſuch <hi>as do in ſimplicity partake of your traditions, to be true Chriſtians nevertheles,</hi> Albeit in your conſtitution they can not by the word of God ſo be counted,<note place="margin">

                        </note> as hath ben proved: yet I pray tell vs, what then you think of thoſe that partake with your traditions, not of <hi>ſimplicity,</hi> but as your ſelf do: that is, knowing them to be <hi>againſt the Second Commaundement; of Antichriſt; vaine vvorſhipp; never but nought &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the <hi>third point of my aunſvver,</hi> I noted two differences between your caſe and the Iewes: the firſt towching the Law it ſelf, the ſecond towching the obſervation of it. For the <hi>Lavv,</hi> I ſhewed that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God given by Moſes (even the written word) being the Law
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:177485:59"/>
of that Church, it did not appoint but forbid thoſe traditions: Yours contrarilie. For the <hi>obſervation,</hi> I ſhewed that the traditions were not generallie obſerved of all the members of that Church, as yours be. Both theſe I proved by the Scripture, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.5-10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.21. <hi>&amp;c. Mat.</hi> 5.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.2. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.34. Where marke in <hi>Iohn</hi> thoſe words of Chriſt to the Iewes <hi>[In your Law]</hi> ſpeaking of the written word. Now vnto this ſo plaine evidence you aunſwer nothing at all to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>For the former, you ſeem at firſt to yeeld, that theſe traditions were <hi>not commaunded by the Law of that Church?</hi> But yet being ſo <hi>generally received,</hi> and they <hi>rebuked</hi> who vſed them not, you count it to be as good. Which I denie. Then you would prove theſe to be the Law of that Church, becauſe they are called<note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.5.</note> 
                        <hi>the Traditions of the Elders.</hi> But even by this appeareth, that they were not the <hi>Law</hi> of that Church, but a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition received from hand to hand from their forefathers. Which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bound not anie, neither were obſerved by all, as it is with you. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was their caſe then, as the Iewes is now with their <hi>Thalmud;</hi> or as the Turks with their <hi>Alcoran;</hi> neither as the Papiſts or yours with the <hi>Canon Law.</hi> If it had ben ſuch, then could they not have ben a true Church. And to vnderſtand this to be <hi>the ordinance of their preſent Governours</hi> (as to ſerve your turne you could be content) is altogeather without ground. It is both againſt the common vſe of the word <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> here vrged, and againſt the true meaning of the word <hi>Elders</hi> in this place:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 5 21.27.33.</note> which plainelie appeareth by another word vſed in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. in ſuch ſence as this is here, and in ſtead thereof, ſignifying <hi>Them of old tyme,</hi> or the like.</p>
                     <p>For the latter, that is the obſervation, you would prove out of<note n="*" place="margin">

                        <hi>Mark, that they were generally received.</hi> If you meane, they were received of <hi>very many,</hi> but not of <hi>all,</hi> you ſpeak nothing againſt that which I ſaid. If you meane they were received of <hi>all</hi> among them (as the words ſeem to ſound) then you miſvnderſtand and miſalledge that Scripture. I will ſhew it by a like ſpeach vſed alſo by <hi>Mark</hi> in another place, where he ſaith, <hi>all the countrey of Iudea and they of Ieruſalem came out to Iohn,</hi>

                        <hi>and vvere all baptiſed of him &amp;c.</hi> Now by the word <hi>All</hi> in this place he meaneth onely a great many, and not everie one, as the word might ſeem to import. For that <hi>all</hi> were not baptiſed of him, is evident both by<note n="“" place="margin">

YOur firſt anſwer is, <hi>that you deny the Aſſumption.</hi> Which in plaine termes is aſmuch, as if you had given the holy Ghoſt the lye, who by the Apoſtle Paule affirmeth it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2.3.4. As in the proof of the <hi>Aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> was ſhewed before. But for the more evidence of the truth, I will ſet this downe in a <hi>Syllogiſme,</hi> thus:</p>
                     <p>If a <hi>Galatian</hi> ſubmitting to <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> though he hold all the truths of the Goſpell profeſſed in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d withall, yet be notwithſtanding abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed from Chriſt, and falne from grace, Then is he not in this eſtate a true Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>But the former is true, as the Apoſtle teſtifieth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2, 3, 4.</p>
                     <p>Therefore alſo the latter. And yet the former you deny, that is the <hi>Aſſumption.</hi> Therefore you give the lie to the holy Ghoſt, who affirmeth it.</p>
                     <p>Next you aunſwer, <hi>that the Galatians vvere then true Chriſtians, and their Aſſemblies, Churches, Gal</hi> 1.2. <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſay you) <hi>this Reaſon is nought.</hi> But you may not thus runne away with the matter and deceive your ſelf and your ſimple favourers. The queſtion is not, <hi>Whether any Galatians vvere true Chriſtians, or any of their Aſſemblies, true Churches.</hi> For who ever doubted of that? But this is the queſtion, <hi>Whether a Galatian holding all the truths of the Goſpell novv profeſſed in England, and vvithall ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting to Circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; vvere in that eſtate a true Chriſtian.</hi> Or putting the caſe that there were whole Aſſemblies conſiſting of ſuch: <hi>Whether thoſe Aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blies then in that caſe were by Gods word to be deemed the true Churches of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:177485:61"/>
Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtle teſtifieth and ſaith <hi>No:</hi> You ſay, <hi>Yea.</hi> Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of you two it is meet wee beleeve, let all men iudge.</p>
                     <p>But what is it then (will you ſay) that the Apoſtle termeth <hi>the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the Galatians true Churches? Gal.</hi> 1.2. You ſhew the reaſon your ſelfe, the light of the truth is ſo cleare and manifeſt: <hi>There were but ſome of the Galatians that were infected with this error of Circumciſion.</hi> True in deed, and of ſuch onelie is the ſuppoſition made in the caſe aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the Churches of Galatia generally were not ſuch, but held the ſaving faith ſound:</hi> This alſo is moſt true: they being ſet in the way and order of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And therefore although there ſprang vp ſome heretikes and ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes among them (which is the<note n="†" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19. Act. 20.30.</note> lot and triall of the Church of God in all ages) yet was there not cauſe to break Communion with thoſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, but to proceed with them in the faith and order of Chriſt, and to<note n="‡" place="margin">

                     <p>Now this being duelie weighed, it is nothing for but altogeather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the having of communion with the Aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies of this Land, which are not ſet in the way and order of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> (as were thoſe <hi>Churches of Galatia</hi>) but in the Apoſtaſie and confuſion of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as hath ben at large declared before, in the defence of the former Reaſons, where alſo that of <hi>Maiſter Cranmer, Ridley, &amp;c.</hi> is anſwered.</p>

TO this your Defence of your Third Reaſon, I anſwer. Firſt it is too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent a cavillation “ <hi>That you charge me to giue the H.

                     <p>Secondly, to ceaſe needles ſtrife, I deny therefore your Propoſition. Though a Galatian<note n="‡" place="margin">that is, so holding it as the worst did or els this is a ſophisticall aequiuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </note> holding Circumciſion, cannot be a true Chriſtian, yet an Engliſh Chriſtian holding the Hierarchye &amp;c. may. The Reaſon of this denyall I gave you then, but that you would not ſee it: Namelie, becauſe ſuch Galatians, held Iuſtification by the workes, and ceremonies of the Law. Gal. 5.3.4.5. Rom. 10.3.4. Act. 15.1. Like the Papiſts, who by their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall and morall workes doe hold the ſame, and ſo doe erre Fundamentally. But our Churches and ſtate, hold not the Hierarchye ſo, but onely as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different thing in it ſelf. This blaſphemous opinion of Circumciſion, maketh it infinitelie worſe (though once it was ordeined of God) then our indifferent opinion of the Hierarchye, though in deed it were never but nought.</p>
                     <p>Thirdlie and laſtlie, you have no where cleared Maiſter Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, and the reſt of thoſe holy Martyrs, from being aboliſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt, if the Hyerarchie be ſimply worſe then Circumciſion, ſo held as thoſe Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians did hold, Gal. 5.2.3.4.5.</p>

IS it of ſimplicity, or of impudency, or of both <hi>(Mr Iacob)</hi> that thus you do write? Your <hi>ſimplicity</hi> is more then Dunſicall, to ſay you denyed <hi>not my Aſſumption, but one of your owne.</hi> For with whom I pray you, do you diſpute? With your ſelf, or with me? Your <hi>impudency</hi> is to ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, not onely <hi>to give the holy Ghoſt the lye,</hi> but when it is ſhewed you, yet not to acknowledge it.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to hide it (if poſſibly you could) you ſay when you denyed the Aſſumption, <hi>you meant not myne, but one of your owne made briefer &amp;c.</hi> Yet even thus appeareth, that you can not ſay otherwiſe but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny my Aſſumption (which I proved by Scripture) were to give the holy Ghoſt the lye. Now that you did it before, your owne words here againe will teſtify againſt you. For you ſay, <hi>Your Aſſumption made briefer, conteyneth the effect of myne.</hi> Then in denying your owne, it muſt needs be that you denyed myne in deed and effect, and ſo now by your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion it is true (as I ſaid) that you <hi>gave the lye to the holy Ghoſt, who by Paul affirmeth it. Gal.</hi> 5.2.4.</p>
                     <p>Simple Sir Prieſt, Had you no more wit nor better defence, then to aunſwer thus as he that hath but halfe an eye may ſee you do nothing els but impudently cavill?

Content your ſelf <hi>(Mr Iacob)</hi> to keep hereafter within your line, and ſtrive no longer againſt the truth, but for it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly you ſay, <hi>to ceaſe needles ſtrife you deny the Propoſition.</hi> But if your former denyall of the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> was good, why do you not ſtand to it?

                        <hi>that although a Galatian holding Circumciſion cannot be a true Chriſtian, yet an Engliſh Chriſtian holding the Hierarchy &amp;c. may.</hi> But you ſhould ſay thus <hi>Mr Iacob,</hi> if you aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me, <hi>He that ſubmitteth to a falſe Miniſtery, worſhip, and gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Church deviſed by Antichriſt the man of ſinne, &amp;c.</hi> is a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in that eſtate.

Nay, it is for the badnes of it: becauſe all is nought, all deceitfull and ſophiſticall. Therefore I muſt diſtinguiſh euen ſo ſtill as I did before, and my diſtinction is good, cleerelie diſcouering all your fraude. What ſay you againſt it: Firſt (you ſay) <hi>Are not their outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and ceremonies falſe, Antichristian and accurſed, aſwell as the rest of their worſhip &amp; ſeruice?</hi> Aſwell? Forſooth, I trow not, (that is, not as much). Their inwarde impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and falſe faith againſt Chriſt, the onely all-ſufficient Sauiour, is farre more accurſed and diueliſh then their bare outward orders, ſeparated from the reſt of their faith. But whoſoeuer ioyneth <hi>ſimply,</hi> and indifferently, either to <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh,</hi> ot <hi>Popiſh</hi> Aſſemblies, doeth ioyne vvith their vvhole and vvorſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, vvhich haue no communion or coherence vvith Chriſt in deed, Neither can vve alſo, if vve ioyne therein. The caſe is not like, vvhen vve reteyne and vſe, ſome of their outvvarde orders in our Aſſemblies.</p>
                     <p>And here you note that I graunt <hi>Some thinge may be ioyned vnto our Christian faith in England, which would vtterly destroy it.</hi> Moſt true, And here I note your moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian and falſe dealing vvith me, in affirming othervviſe of me, As I have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> expreſſed in the beginning, about the taking of my Firſt maine Propoſition there. Which ſee further in pag. 6.</p>
                     <p>Laſtlie, my reference to the anſvvere of your Firſt Reaſon, is a fit and full Refutation of you here, Neither is your Defence any thing againſt it, as there appeareth. Alſo this your Reaſon includeth Maiſter Cranmer, Ridley: &amp;c. to be no true Chriſtians neither, as hath bene often alleadged.</p>

SOphiſticall <hi>diſtinctions</hi> (all men know) are the woonted refuges of bad cauſes. That yours is ſuch, I ſhewed before.

HAve you ſaid any thing here firſt <hi>(Mr Iacob)</hi> but denyed the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? If you have, ſhew it. If not, confeſſe your owne <hi>childiſh va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and open beggery, &amp;c.</hi> For which the name of <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> is to good, though otherwiſe it be bad ynough, and the cogniſance of all your Replies. Now that this you ſay is but the denyal of the Concluſion, thus I ſhew, That which I conclude towching your Churches is this, that they are not conſtitute according to the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Chriſt but according to the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſy of Antichriſt, that is, <hi>that your Churches in their eſtate are ſpirituall Babylon.</hi> This (I ſay) is that which I have concluded heretofore, and ſtill do throughout my Reaſons, Exceptions, Aunſwers: and now of purpoſe have I ſet it downe at the beginning of this treatiſe.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 3.</note> Your denying of this then, what is it els but the denyall of the <hi>Concluſion?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this now being proved, you are driven (nill ye, will ye) plainely to <hi>graunt that in deed my Reaſon will follow.</hi> Well <hi>Mr Iacob,</hi> though it were long firſt, yet thus you yeeld now at length. Better late thrive, then never. Abide but by this, and I trow you will not now any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſtand member or Miniſter of your Aſſemblies in that eſtate, neyther condemne vs any more for ſeparating from them.</p>
                     <p>Next, howſoever it were for the queſtion between vs, yet <hi>the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Compariſon cannot but be true, which in your firſt Reply you ſaid was <hi>moſt falſe,</hi> and now you would paſſe by, becauſe you can ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt it.

                     <p>By all this then you may ſee, it is your owne dealing that is <hi>moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, abſurd, ſenceleſſe &amp;c.</hi> thus to ſtrive (as you have done) againſt ſo cleare a truth, and everie where in your Replyes to fight againſt God and his word. Which even here againe you ceaſe not to do, whiles you call ſuch alluſions and compariſons as the Scripture vſeth between the typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and ſpirituall Babylon, <hi>meer deluſions and vayne cavils.</hi> How I mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched together on the one hand, <hi>the veſſells of the Lords Temple and the

THe Samaritans (thoſe counterfeit children of Abraham Iſaak and Iacob) did publiquely profeſſe that moſt excellent doctrine of <hi>the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias to come</hi> (the truth of which doctrine how powerfull it was to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Scriptures teſtify).

That although the Samaritans profeſſed this ſaving truth, yet (being falſe worſhippers of God) they could not truly challendge vnto themſelves in ſuch eſtate, the benefite thereof. 2. That the Iewes and they which held their faith, being then the true Church and people of God, to whom his Oracles were committed, and to whom his Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantes and ſervice did appertayne, Chriſt therefore accounted the Iewes (and not the Samaritans) to be the true worſhippers of God and heires of ſalvation. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4.22. <hi>compared with ver.</hi> 20.25.29. <hi>and with</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>The people and aſſemblies, whoſe Eccleſiaſticall conſtitution is ſuch as to them in that eſtate the Covenantes, holy things, and ſervice of God do not appertayne, they can not in ſuch conſtitution by the word of God be deemed true Chriſtians or true Churches, whatſoever truthes they profeſſe beſides.</p>

                     <p>The people and Aſſemblies whoſe Eccleſiaſticall conſtitution is ſuch, as they worſhip God after a falſe maner, never appointed by himſelf, nor approved in his word: their conſtitution is ſuch, as vnto them in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, the covenaunts, holy things, and ſervice of God do not apperteine.</p>
                     <p>But ſuch is the Eccleſiaſticall conſtitution of the people and Aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies of England, as they worſhip God after a falſe maner, never appointed by himſelf, nor approved in his word.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Eccleſiaſticall conſtitution of the people and Aſſemblies of England is ſuch, as vnto them in that eſtate, the Couenaunts, holy things, and ſervice of God, do not apperteyne.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> was proved by the example of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and by <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſpeach concerning them in ſuch eſtate, <hi>Ioh. 4. &amp; 2 King. 17.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto you anſwer nothing to any purpoſe, ſave that what you ſay, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your ſelf. For where you graunt, <hi>That the Samaritans, and Balaam knew and beleeved the Meſſias ſhould come, yea and that the Divels know &amp; beleev there is a God, and that Ieſus is the Chriſt, the holy one of God:</hi> Who ſeeth not, that moſt excellent truthes may be acknowledged, and yet they which ſo profeſſe, be not therfore in their eſtate true Chriſtians or true Churches, to whom the Couenauntes, holy things and ſervice of God do apperteine?</p>
                     <p>And where next you ſay, <hi>The Samaritans beleeved not in the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> it will be heard for you to proove it, ſeeing you take <hi>beleefe</hi> in Chriſt ſo, as it is had in the ſpirituall Babylon and her daguhters; and ſeeing alſo the Samaritans profeſſed and beleeved, not onely that the Meſſias ſhould come, but even <hi>he which is called Chriſt, and that when he came he would declare vnto them all things.</hi> In ſo much as when <hi>Ieſus</hi> was come, and had ſpoken but to a woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> the Scripture witneſſeth, that many of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> of that city beleved <hi>[in him]</hi> for the ſaying of the woman which teſtifyed, <hi>he hath tolde me all things that ever I did. Iohn 4.25.26.29.30.39.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly where you ſay, <hi>The Samaritans ioined Heathniſh Idols with the God of Iſraell, whih wholy deſtroyed the trueth in them:</hi> By this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine it is evident, even in your owne confeſſion, both that ſuch things may be ioyned with the doctrines of trueth, as (in that eſtate) they which profeſſe thoſe truthes, can not be iudged <hi>true Chriſtians or true Churches,</hi> to whom the promiſes and holy things of God do belong; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo, the <hi>Propoſition</hi> of your principall and maine Argument is not generall, but of neceſſitie admitteth limitation.

IN this your defence of your 6. Reaſon you ſay, <hi>That the Propoſition of your last ſyllogiſme, [They that worſhip God after a falſe manner,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pag. 106.</note> 
                        <hi>are no true Christians] is proved by the example of the Samaritans, and that I anſwer nothing against it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt I ſay there you ſophiſticate againe. And it ſeemeth you can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in argumentation. For your Propoſition is <hi>aequivocall</hi> and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous. If you meane they that vvorſhip God after a falſe manner, that is <hi>totally</hi> or els <hi>Fundamentally.</hi> Then I cleerely graunt it, and that the Samaritans doe prove the ſame, ſeeing they erred <hi>Fundamentally.</hi> But your Aſſumption touching vs, is then vtterly falſe. You bring not a ſyllable or one letter, to prove either of theſe tvvo againſt vs, in all your writing, neyther can you, but bare begging of the controverſie which is infinite ofte. If you meane in your Propoſition, They that ſerve God after a falſe maner, that is, in part, not <hi>wholly</hi> nor <hi>Fundamentally,</hi> As namely in the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> and externall ceremonies as <hi>Cranmer</hi> &amp;c. Then I ſay and a vouch confidently in the preſence of God, that ſuch may be true Chriſtians, though vnperfect in many things. Yea infinite, ſuch have ben, are, and may be hereafter, true Chriſtians. The contrarie whereof, is no leſſe then horrible blaſphemy againſt God and his Saincts, wherefore your Propoſition is ſhewed to be againe ſophiſticall, as alſo thoſe were in your Third Exception, &amp; Firſt and Second Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Secondly where you ſay, <hi>the Samaritans prove it, &amp;</hi> I <hi>ſay nothing against it.</hi> Marke you. Firſt I ſaid, the Samaritans might knowe by hearſay, and yet not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully beleeve [in] the Meſſias. You cannot be ignorant, that there is a great difference between an obſcure rumor, which ſome of them might receiue from their neighbour Iewes, and yet not haue it conſtantly beleeued, and held publiquely among them, as their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon faith. If thus the <hi>Samaritans</hi> beleeued the comming of <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> they are in no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon with vs, we holde our moſt holy faith and doctrine by the worde profeſſedly, as the publique ordinance of our Churchs ſheweth. But furder let it be howſoeuer they held the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> yet I anſwered, The <hi>Samaritans</hi> ioyned Heatheniſh Idols wih the God of Iſraell which wholly deſtroyed the trueth in them. And this is the very truth indeed, howſoeuer you vvill not yeld it. For you ſay, <hi>that they broke not the First commaundement, they worſhipped not the Idols themſelues, nor ſacrifiſed to them, &amp;c.</hi> This is proued apparantly falſe in the Text. 2 kings. 17.29, 30, 31. <hi>Every nation made their Gods and put them in the houſes of the high places which the Samaritans had made, euery nation in their Citties wherein they dwelt.</hi>

And the Auims made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharuims burnt their children in the fyer to Adramdech &amp; Anammelech the Gods of Sepharuim:</hi> Therefore they vvorſhipped the Idols of the Heathen and ſacrifized to them, and accompted them to be Gods aſvvell as the God of Iſraell.

For though <hi>Ieroboam</hi> at the Firſt had not ioined in the Heatheniſh Idolatry, Yet <hi>Ahab</hi> did 1 King. 16.32.33. and his Sonne <hi>Ahaziah</hi> had further <hi>Baalzebub</hi> the God of <hi>Ekron.</hi> Yea the Iſraelites, as they of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> afterwards, were Idolaters much alike 2 King. 17.19.

Therefore the Samaritans doing as the Iſraelites did, held ſuch groſſe Idolatry as could by no meanes ſtand with the true ſeruing of God.

                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 109.</note> Surely it appeareth more groſſe and worſe then the Iſraelites before them. And therefore you are greatly deceived both here and in the defence of your Firſt Reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before:<note place="margin">

In the Goſpell we are taught as plainly and as fully for the word it ſelf, as the Iewes were in Moſes: But it is not yet ſo plaine for our vnderſtanding and vſe. Why? Becauſe wee haue had a diſcontinuance of the<note n="‡" place="margin">The Paſtors of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſince, have had ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mixed in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, they have not ben pure &amp; ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ever ſince or at laſt vve cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe, by any records novv extant.</note> ſimple offices of Paſtours, Teachers and Elders for the ſpace of a Thouſand Three hundreth, or a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Four hundreth Yeares, and a continuance of the Prelacie all this while hetherto.

And they haue expounded the Scriptures ſo that they carry no ſmall ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity in this matter, in infinite Thouſands iudgement. Thus it hath pleaſed God in his prouidence, to ſuffer this miſtaking amongeſt Chriſtians, thus longe, &amp; thus vniuerſally. Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that infinite Thouſand conſciences are not eaſely conuicted, though they bee miſtaken in this caſe. With the Iewes it vvas not ſo in this matter that vve talke of. As Moſes and the Prophets vvere moſt plain, that Ieruſalem muſt be the onlie place of ſolemne worſhip, Arons line the onely Prieſts, no Calues, nor any viſible kinde of Image or meanes to worſhip God in: So alſo they conſtantly and perpetually practized that courſe, euen from Moſes till the Apoſtacie of

                     <p>Words in deed you have ynough, as thinking belike that at leaſt you have ſome ſhow on your ſide: but they are all to no purpoſe, ſave againſt your ſelves. I will now examine them from point to point.</p>
                     <p>Firſt for the Reaſon it ſelf, the <hi>Propoſition</hi> of the firſt Syllogiſme being ſo cleare as you can with no colour deny it, you come therefore to the latter.

Thus firſt you ſet it downe; <hi>They that vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God after a falſe manner, are no true Chriſtians.</hi> But put on your ſpectacles, or (if you pleaſe) your eye of glaſſe, and trye agayne if you can read any better.

Why do you ſtill tranſforme my words and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments into others of your owne? Is it becauſe you can find no aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to them, as I have propounded them?

Look to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian Churches, to the Papiſts, to anie other falſe worſhippers of God profeſſing Chriſt: and ſee if their caſe be ſuch. Do they not hold and preach much truth? Do they not baytize <hi>in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt? &amp;c.</hi> If you ſay, where the conſtitution of a Church eſtabliſheth a falſe worſhip of God never preſcribed by himſelf, there though they ſeem to have ſome good things, yet by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and practiſe their whole worſhip is falſe before God <hi>totally:</hi> then ſay I alſo your caſe is ſuch, and therefore ſo of vs to be eſteemed.

Towching which (I meane, the ordinance of your Church) you may ſee <hi>D. Bilſon</hi> hath the better of you: though otherwiſe, by the word of God, it is plaine he hath the worſe, and ſtandeth in a deteſtable error, both againſt all proportion of faith, and againſt the expreſſe evidence of theſe Scriptures, <hi>Luk. 23.46. with Pſal. 31.5.

                     <p>But tell me now <hi>Mr Iacob,</hi> what power of Chriſt your Church hath,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:177485:75"/>
and in whoſe hands it is to excommunicate <hi>D. Bilſon</hi> for teaching and mainteining this or any other falſe doctrine a mong you? Your ſelf are a member of that Church together with him: You haue written againſt him, and by the word of God convinced him. He notwithſtanding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, and leaveneth others as much as he can.

Or if your Church haue not that power of Chriſt (as all may ſee), why do you not confeſſe it to be none of Chriſts?

                     <p>In the third place, I proved the <hi>Samaritans</hi> ſinne to be againſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond commaundement, inaſmuch as worſhipping the true God, they did it in and by the Images they framed.

                     <p>The words then (when it is ſaid, <hi>they made Gods &amp;c.</hi>) are not lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie to be taken, but ſacramentallie, attributing that in phraſe of ſpeach to the ſigne, which in deed is peculiar to the thing ſignified.

                     <p>Mind further, that the Scripture relating the ſinne of the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans vſeth the verie ſame words and like phraſe of ſpeach as is in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond commaundement: It ſaith, they <hi>made</hi> them Gods, that is, <hi>Images</hi> (as it is expounded,<note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 17 29.33.41.</note>

                     <p>Further you alledge <hi>2 Chron. 11.15.</hi> Where Ieroboam is ſaid to <hi>appoint Prieſts for the high places, and for Divels, and for the Calves he had made.</hi> So have you alſo appointed <hi>Prieſts</hi> (ſuch as God never ordeined) and that for your <hi>high places and Calves,</hi> that is, for your Idols Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Service, the places and maner of your publik worſhip to this day.

                        <hi>and falſe worſhip,</hi> I have written in another treatiſe, to which I refer you.</p>
                     <p>Where it is ſaid, <hi>Ieroboa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> appointed Prieſts for Divels,</hi> you are to know (if already you do not) that this is ſpoken myſtically, in reſpect of Gods account, and as it was in deed, not that Ieroboam and the people did ſo think and eſteem it themſelves. And that you may have leſſe preiudice of this which I ſay, heare it of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> who writeth thus of it: <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam and his complices ſaid, they worſhipped not the Calves, but Iehovah in that figure &amp; viſible ſigne: but the Scripture in the Chronicles witneſſeth their imagination to be fruſtrate, becauſe in deed they did that ſervice not to Iehovah, but to Divels.

Even ſo it was with <hi>Ieroboam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Further for the more clearing of this matter, ſee what it is in deed thus to <hi>worſhip Divels:</hi> And heare it of <hi>Mr Iunius,</hi> whoſe judgement (I know) in this caſe you will judge leſſe partiall. He in his notes vpon <hi>Lev. 17.7.</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>Men ſacrifice to Divels, if they ſacrifice eyther in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place or after other rite and maner then the Lord hath preſcribed: See

Deut. 32.17. &amp; 1 Cor. 10.20.</hi> And this he ſheweth was the ſinne of the Iewes, both in Egypt, and in the wildernes: firſt by <hi>Exod. 32. chapter:</hi> then by<note n="‡" place="margin">

                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, yet you both contradict and condemne your ſelf. Your contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, that here you ſay Iſrael it ſelf held not the written Law for their rule; and yet in the very next ſentence before preferred them afore the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in this reſpect: Or els you ſpeake nothing to the purpoſe. Your condemnation of your eſtate is, that by this reaſon of yours, neither doth your Church hold the written Law for your rule: ſeing you have as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedlie (as they) left this rule, and do as conſtantly worſhip according
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:177485:80"/>
to your Sevice beaſt taken out of the <hi>Popes porruis,</hi> and by your Prieſts and Prelates, vnlawfull as the <hi>Calves</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> of Ieroboam. Not to ſpeak of your Idoll Temples, a breach of the ſecond commaundement, as <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> were. Beſides, although the Iſraelites in their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſy left the written Law of God (as you alſo have done in yours) yet did they not in word profeſſe ſo to do (anie more then you) but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily: As I proved before out of Ioſephus, Peter Martyr, and the Scripture it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly you except, <hi>that Ezechiel ſheweth even here, cap. 43.7.8. they kept not this rule, but departed therefrom, and that as appeareth profeſſedly and conſtantly &amp;c.</hi> But marke how both here and before you chaunge the queſtion: which is not whether they kept this rule, but whether they profeſſed to keep it, ſo as they did. I ſhewed that the joining of <hi>Gods Threſholds and their ovvne togeather,</hi> did argue their profeſſion in word, but breach in deed. Their profeſſion in word, whiles they pretended to retaine <hi>Gods threſholds:</hi> their breach in deed, whiles they added <hi>their ovvne</hi> withall. To make the caſe more plaine, ſee it in your owne eſtate. Do not you profeſſe in word the written Law to be your rule? Yet do you not alſo break it in deed, whiles you joine <hi>your treſholds with Gods,</hi> that is, your invencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s with his ordinances? To the examples of <hi>Ahab, Ahaziah &amp;c.</hi>

As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, you profeſſe <hi>the forbidding of meats and mariage at certaine tymes: the worſhip preſcribed in your Service-book and other the like, by read prayer; deviſed Homilyes: Saints dayes: Communion to one alone: women to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize: Miniſtery of Prieſts, and Prelates: Apocrypha; and the reſt before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>Next followed the Aſſumption to be aunſwered: which was this. <hi>Such is the eccleſiaſticall conſtitution of the people and Aſſemblyes of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland as they worſhip God after a falſe maner,</hi>

And whereas you were told of hiding the fowle heap of your <hi>Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> vnder the terme of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> you neither denie it nor amend it, but do ſtill vſe the ſame fraude.

                     <p>Now where you ſay, <hi>it is a iuſt defence of your Miniſtery, vvorſhip, &amp; eſtate to be as tovvching the ſubſtance and foundation of Chriſtianity ſound and acceptable to God, if your Aſſemblies throughout the Land have not their conſciences convicted therein:</hi> You may bluſh for ſhame to ſpeak ſo ſenceleſſlie. If you meane, that your Miniſterie, worſhip, and eſtate is not in truth of the ſubſtance and foundation of Chriſtianitie, then by your owne words you ſtand in a ſtraunge and fearfull eſtate: beſides that you ſpeak not to the point in hand, and ſo there is in your ſpeach no ſence at all. Or if you meane, that howſoever your Miniſtery, worſhip, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:177485:80"/>
eſtate be, whether approved of God or not, whether Antichriſtian or whatſoever els, yet your Church-conſtitution is for ſubſtance and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Chriſtianitie ſound and acceptable to God: then is your ſpeach againe moſt ſenceles and abſurd. For how is it poſſible, that your Miniſterie, worſhip, and eſtate ſhould be condemned by God, Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, or the like: and yet your Church-conſtitution either have the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and foundation of Chriſtianitie, or be in ſuch a way ſound and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God? To be diſallowed of God, and to be acceptable to him, are contraries. Finally, howſoever your meaning be, yet ſtill your ſpeach is ſenceles and vntrue. For<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>But you pretend three reaſons of this your aſſertion.

                     <p>You pretend alſo <hi>(2) the opinion of many auncient and late learned godly Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s:</hi> and <hi>(3) their expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Scriptures ſo as herein they cary ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity, in infinite Thouſands iudgment.</hi> To both which I anſwer: <hi>1.</hi> That great <hi>antiquity</hi> was alledged by the Samaritans, <hi>Ezra. 4.2.

There is not teſtimony from ſuch antiquity as you ſpeak of, for your Prelacy and the reſt of your abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations before rehearſed: <hi>Pag. 63. &amp;c.</hi> If you can therefore, ſhew it in your next.

So as it was a long ſeaſon in this riſing of Antichriſt, ere the Prelacy came to that height, which now it hath with you and in Rome the mother thereof. Search, and ſee if it be not thus. And in the meane tyme (becauſe I know you haue a prejudice of whatſoever I ſay) heare a litle what <hi>Mr Cartwright</hi> (one of your ſelves) hath written of your Prelacy againſt <hi>D.

HEre, being not able with any colour to deny the conſequent of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi> neither to juſtify your preſent <hi>Miniſtery, worſhip, Canons, Articles, Iniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp;c.</hi> (which you muſt do <hi>Mr Iacob,</hi> and ſtill we call for it, if you will juſtify your preſent eſtate): yet being deſperate ſure, for els you would never have done it, you feare not to gainſay the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> that is the very words and teſtimony of the Scripture it ſelf, <hi>1. Tim. 4.1.2.3.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that they which forbidd Mariage and Meats, are depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the faith.</hi> You ſay, No. Now whether (I pray you) ſhall we beleev. You, or the Apoſtle?</p>
                     <p>But what colour have you for your deniall? This forſooth: <hi>That they which doe ſo, do not depart from the faith <hi>totally,</hi> and that the Apoſtles meaning is, that in theſe poincts they depart from the faith, but not abſolutly and wholy.</hi> So by your conceit, none may be accounted departers from the faith, that depart onelie <hi>in ſome poincts,</hi> but they which doe it <hi>totally</hi> from all. And thus may no heretikes or Antichriſts that euer haue bene, or ſhalbe in the world, be iudged <hi>departers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faith,</hi> becauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from it but in ſome poincts, and <hi>not abſolutly</hi> from all. Thus have you juſtified at once the <hi>Arians, Neſtorians, Sabellians, Papiſts, Familiſtes, Anabaptiſtes,</hi> and whom not? becauſe they depart but <hi>in ſome,</hi> not <hi>wholy</hi> from all poincts of faith. Is it not great pitie that Antichriſt hath ſo long wanted ſuch a ſtout Champion, as can thus in one word juſtify his <hi>forbidding of meates and mariage,</hi> yea and his moſt deteſtable <hi>Hierarchie and ſuperſtitions</hi> withall?</p>

                     <p>Secondly tell vs, whether there are no other poincts but theſe three in the Papiſts Religion, which make them in their eſtate to be <hi>departers from the faith,</hi> and conſequentlie <hi>falſe Chriſtians and falſe Churches?</hi> If there be (as you can not deny) of what weight then is your anſwer to defend the preſent conſtitution of your people and aſſemblies, ſeeing there are divers other things beſides theſe, that do and may cauſe, that you can not be deemed <hi>true Chriſtians or true Churches</hi> in that eſtate.

                     <p>Thirdly your manner of reaſoning heer for your defence, is as if the <hi>Adulterers,</hi> to juſtify their courſe of life, ſhould alledge thus, We are <hi>(1) no Blaſphemers (2) no Perſecutors (3) no Murtherers,</hi> as ſuch and ſuch are: therefore we depart not from the way of life, but our eſtate and courſe of life is good, and ſuch as may be continued in.

                        <hi>whoſoever ſhall keep the vvhole Lavv, and yet faileth in one poinct, is guiltie of all.

                     <p>Firſt, doe I ſay No to the Apoſtles Yea, 1. Tim. 4.1.2.3. <hi>That they who forbid Mariage and Meates doe fall from the faith.</hi> Doe I ſay noe? Is this your conſcience? Say I not expreſly, They doe in theſe points departe from the faith, but not <hi>Abſolutly</hi> and <hi>wholy.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:177485:88"/>Secondly, doeth it follow by my words, as you affirme, <hi>That none departe from the faith but thoſe that departe totally, wholy, and abſolutely, whereby all the vildest Heretikes ſhould be iustified, as Arrians, Nestorians, Anabaptists, &amp;c.</hi> Doe I ſay ſo? Is this alſo your conſcience? Againe doe I ſay, <hi>The text doth not reproue all the Papists in their forbidding of Mariage and Meates, but only Martion and Tatianus of old?</hi> Doe I ſay any ſuch thing? Nay, ſay I not expreſlie the contrarie? Are you then a man of conſcience? Doe you ſuffer for conſcience? Know therefore that this I ſay, and my wordes before doe import ſo much. That whoſoever doe forbid mariage or meates, doe depart from the faith. But note: ſome doe more, ſome leſſe. There are ſome that doe ſimply and fundamentally, and others in ſome ſorte. Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte from the faith Simply and Fundamentally two wayes. Firſt they which doe erre in ſuch maine poincts as doe vtterly aboliſh vs from Chriſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation: thus doe Arrians, Manichees, Seruetus, Papiſtes, &amp;c. Secondly, ſuch as holding the Foundation in doctrine ſound, doe deſperatly profeſſe and teach ſome what els, againſt the manifeſt light that is in them: ſo Martion and Tatianus, doe Fundamentally and ſimply fall from the faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſimply forbid thoſe good ordinances of God, Marriage and Meates euen againſt the light of conſcience &amp; nature: togeather wherewith, a liuely ſaving faith cannot poſſibly ſtand. Now the Papiſts in this do departe from the faith alſo, but that is only in ſome ſorte or in parte: becauſe they forbid theſe things (not abſolutly, but) vnto ſome, &amp; ſometimes. They that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part thus from the faith, may bee true Chriſtians notwithſtanding, yea they are certenly, if they be no worſe in any thing els, albeit you deny it here moſt fondly &amp; without all ſence. To which end you moſt vnlernedly and vngodly apply thoſe ſcriptures, <hi>A litle leauen leueneth the lump, A few dead flyes make the oyntment to stinke,</hi>

Is it not poſſible your ſelves might hold ſome ſuch errors, &amp; yet remayne true Chriſtians notwithſtanding? Then if Papiſts vvere no vvorſe but in thoſe errors only they might be true Chriſtians notwithſtanding. But Martion and Tatianus doe wholy departe from the faith, not but that they beleued ſome truthes: but in that they<note n="”" place="margin">The ſame did Corah, Dathan and Abiram like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.

                        <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly</hi> quenched the inſtinct of nature &amp; conſcience, as I haue ſaid. Here then it appeareth how wicked a ſclaunder it is that you ſay, <hi>I runne into the Papistes tents, and fight with their weapons, &amp; doe iump with the Remists annotations, on</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3.

                     <p>And note, that I ſave, that they be either Apoſtates or departers from the faith, not onely who fall <hi>totally,</hi> as you ſclaunder me that I ſaye: but alſo who fall <hi>fundameneally,</hi> that is, eyther the firſt way or ſecond, as I haue afore ſaide.

                     <p>You have contradicted the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and yet have neither conſcience nor will to acknowledge it, no not when it is told you.

As if the doctrines of Divels were not bad ynough to make them Antichriſtians?

                     <p>Yet mynd further, <hi>Whoſoever</hi> (ſay you) <hi>do forbid mariage and meats, they do depart from the faith.

The Propoſition or firſt part is the<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.3</note> Apoſtles ſaying, and now at length yeelded vnto by yourſelf. The Aſſumption or ſecond part is the eſtate and practiſe both of your Church and the Papiſts: As I have proved before, and you have left vnaunſwered, being not able to ſpeake one word in defence eyther of their Church or your owne.

Or not ſubiect to wrath in and for ſuch eſtate of your Church? If this be your meaning, ſpeak it out plainelie, and fumble not ſtill in the mouth as you do. But then note for your learning:<note n="*" place="margin">

For is it poſſible that anie ſhould both hold the foundation in doctrine ſound, and yet deſperatlie profeſſe and teach ſomewhat els a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the manifeſt light that is in them? If this be not a Paradoxe, what is? <hi>4.</hi> Yet mynd that now you graunt, <hi>Men may hold the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in doctrine ſound, and yet erre fundamentally other wayes.</hi> Thus you are quite gone <hi>Mr Iacob.</hi> For heretofore you bare vs in hand, that you erre not <hi>fundamentally,</hi> ſo long as you hold the foundation in doctrine ſound. <hi>(Pag. 28. 91. 92. 109. 111.)</hi> This alſo was the ground of your maine Argument, from your book of Articles.

                     <p>For your words then, thus it was: When againſt your Church I had proved by the Apoſtles teſtimonie, that foraſmuch as <hi>all ſuch depart from the faith, as forbid Mariage and Meats: therefore alſo your Church ſo doth, vvhich not only forbiddeth theſe things, &amp; the true Miniſtery &amp; vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God vvithall, but alſo commaundeth a falſe, &amp;c.</hi> You did then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thus, word for word, <hi>The Popiſh forbidding of Mariage and of Meats, if they vvere no vvorſe, doth not make them departers from the faith <hi>totally.</hi> No more could their Hierarchy &amp; ceremonies <hi>ſimply:</hi> Neither do they make vs (the Proteſtans) to be ſuch.

TO this your Eight Reaſon and defence thereof, I aunſwer as before: if you take the Apoſtle to meane, ſuch neglecters of their houſhold as deny the faith, not Fundamentally nor againſt the inſtinct of nature, but only againſt conuenient Chriſtian providence, and no othervviſe: then I deny your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. If the Apoſtle meane of ſuch, as neglect their families againſt the light of conſcience, and natures inſtinct, then I deny the Propoſition. This I ſay, becauſe the Apoſtle may very well meane both theſe, but in diverſe meaſure and proportion of ſinne: but then this concerneth not vs, Even ſo as I have ſaid to your former Reaſon. Note alſo, if this were a true Reaſon, it maketh Maiſter Cranmer, &amp;c. denyers of the faith, and not true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans alſo. For maintenance whereof, you have here not one poore vvord at all.</p>
                     <p>Tovvching that you ſay we cannot deny, but graunt, <hi>that we departe from and deny the faith in our Ministery:</hi> I have told you hovv, in my anſvver to your 7. Reaſon, Alſo ſee my Replyes to your 2. Exception.</p>

NOw that all your ſhifts fayle, you come with <hi>Ifs</hi> and <hi>Ands, If the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle meane this,</hi> and <hi>If he meane that &amp;c.</hi> As if the Apoſtles * words were not playne,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8.</note> ſo as the meaning may eaſily be diſcerned of anie that is not wilfullie blynd. Read and mynd in all ſuch caſes and Scriptures that which is written, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.9. <hi>with Act.</hi> 28.26.27.</p>
                     <p>But you ſay the Apoſtle may very well meane, <hi>both ſuch as neglect their houſhold againſt convenient Chriſtian providence, and ſuch as do it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light of conſcience and natures inſtinct.</hi> If the firſt, then you deny the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> that is, the Apoſtles owne ſaying. And thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine you give the holy Ghoſt the lye. If the latter, then you deny the <hi>Propoſition.</hi> And then you muſt prove, that thus they do it. For who knoweth not, that ſuch will not (for this caſe, any more then you for yours) confeſſe that they do it <hi>againſt light of conſcience &amp;c.</hi> Nay will they not ſay, as ſtiflie as you, <hi>that this concerneth not them?</hi> And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over is not that alſo which is light in one mans conſcience, often darke in another mans by one meanes or other?</p>
                     <p>See it in an example. One of your profeſſors in <hi>London</hi> runneth to all your Sermons and Lectures from place to place throughout the City, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day and every houre. By this meanes he neglecteth his familie.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:177485:94"/>
You tell him he doth it <hi>againſt light of conſcience and natures inſtinct.</hi> He denyes it, and ſaith he doth it not ſo, but as being perſwaded in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that he muſt firſt ſeek the kingdome of God, and that then all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things ſhalbe caſt to him and his. Herevpon (in a blynd zeale) he doth, as aforeſaid. Now tell me, Is not this man notwithſtanding within compaſſe of the Apoſtles rule here ſpoken of? Yet will he ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it for his caſe, as ſtiffe as you for yours: yea and alledge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more colour and ſhow of Reaſon, then you do or can for your Hierarchy <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So then both the Propoſition and Aſſumption ſtand firme againſt you, and therefore alſo the whole Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Now here againe, being loth (belike) to give them any reſt, you call for <hi>Mr Cranmer &amp;c.</hi> As if they were your Pages, to wayte at your heeles on every call, and to ſerve your turne at every need, whether they will or not. Never were poore men in all the world (I think) made ſuch a ſtale. But they ſerve you accordingly. They let you commaund, and go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. For every where you commaund their names, and yet alway go without their fellowſhip. As I have ſhewed before in particular: <hi>Pag.</hi> 40. 41.</p>
                     <p>Towching your graunt, let the Reader note here againe, that you yeeld, <hi>you depart from and deny the faith in your Miniſtery &amp;c.</hi> You ſay, you have before told vs <hi>how.</hi> But what you have ſaid before is there aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and taken away. And beſides, for vs it is ſufficient, <hi>that it is done.</hi> Look you vnto it, <hi>how you do it.</hi> It may be, ſome of you do it of ignorance; ſome of knowledge againſt the light of your owne conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces; ſome for feare of men; ſome for love of the world; ſome of contention, or vaine glory; ſome for their profit, pleaſure, eaſe, honour, quyetnes, or the like. Thus I deny not but in the <hi>maner</hi> of doing, there may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you in theſe reſpects <hi>a divers meaſure and proportion of ſinne.</hi> But this <hi>concerneth</hi> not vs; but <hi>your ſelves</hi> to look vnto: and that greatlie.</p>

                        <label>H. IACOB his 2. Reply to the 9. Reaſon.</label>
IN this your defence of the laſt Reaſon, <hi>you miſlike that I ſay it is a fallacy: and you ſay I ſhew none.</hi> Marke what I ſay, Euery one of your Reaſons, I ſay every one, is a very proper fallacy, and an artificiall parte of Sophiſterie, as by my ſeuerall anſwers to them may appeare. Your Firſt Reaſon is called in the ſcholes <hi>Fallacia ab eo quod est ſecundum quid ad ſimpliciter</hi> prouing a thing to be ſimply, by that which is but after a ſort. The Second is the very ſame. The Third <hi>Fallacia equiuocationis,</hi> A fallacie of Ambiguity. The Fourth is the very ſame. The Fift is <hi>petitio principij,</hi> a begging of the queſtion. The Sixth the very ſame fallacie that was in the Firſt and Second Reaſons. The Seauenth, Eight, and Ninth, haue all the <hi>Fallacy of Equiuocation,</hi> and if you will, the ſame with that, in your Firſt, Second and Sixt Reaſons, alſo.</p>
                     <p>Further, where you ſay, <hi>that here I graunt you the cauſe,</hi> it is very abſurd. The Apoſtle 1 Tim. 6.3.4.5. ſaying, ſeparate from ſuch, hath a two fould ſence, Either ſuch as teach otherwiſe then the trueth <hi>fundamentally,</hi> and then ſeparate wholly: Or <hi>not fundamentally,</hi> but erring only in poincts leſſe then the foundation: and theiſe diuerſely alſo, Either <hi>preſumptuouſly, obstinately,</hi> and of a deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: and then if that appeare, ſeparate from ſuch wholy: Or els, erring in <hi>ſimplicitie</hi> &amp; of ouerſight, and former preiudice, from ſuch, ſeparate nor wholly, but only from the very error or errors, in no wiſe from their Chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and ſocietie, ſeeing theiſe are true Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Seing therefore our corruptions of the Praelacy and Ceremonies, be of theſe latter ſort: which thing hetherto, you haue not nor cannot ouerthrowe, (&amp; withall you muſt vtterly ouerthrowe Maſt. Cranmer &amp; the reſt of the Martirs their Chriſtianitie like wiſe): Therefore wee in England, by the grace of God, are ſtill true Chriſtians: &amp; you ought ſo to acknowledge vs, as you will anſwer vnto God: All which you may doe, &amp; yet touch no parte of our Eccleſiaſticall corruptions at all to giue allowance vnto them: And in all this, there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction with my ſelfe, it is but your diſtempered conceipt, that ſeemeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. Nither is our abſolute departure from the Papiſts, hereby anie whit impeached. Wee haue iuſtlie forſaken them cleane, becauſe by their very profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and doctrine, wee canot eſteeme them true Chriſtians, neither in caſe of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, while they ſo remaine, but indeed very Antichriſts, as the ſcripture proueth. Which thing alſo if you ſay of vs, you ſay falſlie: it is our preſent queſtion, and you doe not proue it, nor euer can doe.</p>
                     <p>As for your 17. poincts of falſe doctrine, which you moſt falſly lay to our chardge, what haue I to doe with them? I liſt not to meddle at this prſent, but with that which wee haue in hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, namely to iuſtifie, that our publike booke of Articles of Religion (ſo farre forth as that it erreth not fundamentally,) conteyneth ſufficient to make a true Chriſtian:<note place="margin">As it doth not.</note> Againſt the which, hetherto you haue brought nothing worth the hearing, as we haue ſeene.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>you would proue vs to be like thoſe Iewes Act.</hi> 19.9. <hi>whom Paul ſeparated from:</hi> But without all good reaſon. They were not ſo many but they were eaſily certified of the truth that Paul preached: but how infinitly many moe are there in this land, that know nothing of this controuerſie. 2. Secondly Paul was better able
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:177485:100"/>
to conuince them by the ſcriptures, and did more effectually, and apparantly, then you doe (or can) our whole Realme. 3. Thirdly how many learned are there in this lande, that have many probable &amp; ſeeming reaſons, &amp; alleadge them, &amp; publiſh them for the Praelacy againſt you: &amp; are vnanſwered. And yet will you ſay they are conuicted, &amp; thoſe infinite others depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding on them? I ſay co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uicted aſwell as thoſe Iewes? What if theſe ſpeake euill of that which you hold for truth, but they hold to be errors &amp; ſchiſme? Are they all yea all the land therefore aboliſhed from Chriſt? Might not all this at leaſt, be ſayd of the whole eſtate of the Iewes in Chriſtes time, and after aſwell, yet they ceaſed not to bee Churches? why then are you ſo partiall againſt vs?</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>you would ſhew Reaſons why the Apostles wholy ſeparated not from the Iewes Synagogues after Christ, Act.</hi> 13.14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which you will in no wiſe haue to ſerue vs. But alas for all your Exceptions againſt vs, you haue neuer a reaſon but one, and that is <hi>petitio principij, That wee were neuer ſeparated from the world, nor ſet in the way &amp; order of Christ, but in the confuſion and defection of Antichrist, whoſe Ministerie, &amp;c. were neuer the ordinances of God, &amp;c.</hi> This is but crauing the whole queſtion. And I haue refuted theſe quarells in a ſhort writing (hereafter following) about the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the Miniſterie with Mariage, which yet you haue no leyſure, to anſwer, this whole three yeares togeather, and vpwarde.</p>
                     <p>And further you doe not ſhew any vtter and apſolute ſeparation from the whole Church of the Iewes a great while after Chriſt: but the contrarie is ſeene Act. 21.23.24.26. though from ſome one or two ſynagogues they ſeparated after full experience of their obſtinate &amp; malitious reſiſtance of the truth, which we deny not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Touching the Concluſion.</label>
In the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion of my former Reply, to proue your vtter ſeparation from vs a Paradox: Firſt, I alledged all the reformed Churches: For who knoweth not but they all hold Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with vs as Churches of God? yet you dare either deny this or vtterly peruert it. You tell vs <hi>of your Anſwers to Maister Cartwright &amp; Mr. Hilderſam that are vnanſwered.</hi> If they be like to this your anſwer here, verely they doe wiſeſt in yeelding ſilence to ſuch friuolous &amp; wandring wordes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly I alleadged your ſelues to haue acknoledged heretofore, That our publique doctrine allowed, would &amp; did make many of vs true Chriſtians. <hi>You too ſhamefully deny it. And ſay you are for witneſſing against it, impriſoned, baniſhed, &amp;c.</hi> Whereto I anſwer, that if for theſe things you are troubled, I know none can pittie you. And becauſe you ſay, none of you euer acknowledged it, I will therefore repeat your owne words.</p>

The faithfull ſervants of Christ (denying the whole constitution and government of this Church of England) may iustly deny the people whilest they remaine in that constitution to be members of a true constituted Church, yet hereby not condemne them with any ſuch peremptory ſentence as Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Gifford ſuggesteth,<note place="margin">Nota, from Chriſt.</note> to cut them of from Gods election, or <hi>from Chriſt.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> doe moreouer willingly confeſſe, That many, both of the Teachers, &amp; alſo of the Profeſſors within theſe Pariſh aſſemblees, haue ſo embraced this truth of doctrine, eſtabliſhed and profeſſed in this Land, as the Lord of his infinite goodnes, hath graunted them the fauour, to <hi>ſhew outwardly</hi> many tokens, whereby (in regard of the Lordes election) <hi>I</hi> profeſſe before men and Angels, that <hi>I</hi> iudge them to be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of that body <hi>whereof the ſonne of God Chriſt Ieſus is the head.</hi> Onely herein the Lord be mercifull vnto them, (as to my ſelf in regard of my ſinnes:) That they are not vnder that <hi>outward</hi> forme of gouernement that Chriſt hath left, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And in his examination before Master Fanſhaw, lately publiſhed by your ſelves in print, he confeſſeth the Churches of England to be the true Churches of Chriſt.</p>

                        <hi>And what ſay you, Maiſter Iohnſon?

In like maner, they which connnunicate in anie part of your worſhip, become thereby parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and guiltie of the whole: though it may be, neither you nor they ſo think.

                     <p>For the <hi>Papiſts</hi> (to omit that you aunſwer not what I obiected) you ſee and graunt readily that <hi>they are no true Chriſtians but very Antichriſts &amp;c.</hi> Yet for your ſelves, though your <hi>Hierarchy, Leitourgy, confuſion of people, falſe doctrines &amp;c.</hi> be meerlie <hi>Popiſh and Antichriſtian,</hi> you will not ſee and acknowledge it.

                     <p>For the <hi>queſtion</hi> between vs, let the Reader iudge how I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, and how you have quitted your ſelf and your Churches.</p>
                     <p>Where you ſay, <hi>the points of falſe doctrine in your Church are moſt falſly laid to your charge,</hi> all may ſee here againe you have an hard forehead to deny anie thing, and yet are ſo ſottiſh you can prove nothing. But you ſay <hi>you liſt not meddle with them at this preſent.</hi> I eaſily beleev you. They are ſo pregnant againſt you, as it is no marvell if you have no liſt to do it. Otherwiſe you ſhew liſt ynough to medle with anie thing that you think may cary any ſhow againſt vs.</p>
                     <p>But you muſt mynd, the point is not, <hi>what you liſt,</hi> but what you ought to meddle withall. You have taken vpon you the defence of your Churches in the eſtate wherein now they ſtand. Therefore muſt you aunſwer aſwell for the falſe doctrines, as for the true, mainteined in your Church. Els would the Papiſts iuſtify their caſe againſt you well y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                     <p>For this cauſe then muſt you aunſwer aſwell for your <hi>Book of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayer and other your books of Articles, Canons, Iniunctions &amp;c.</hi> as for that book of <hi>Articles</hi> which was publiſhed in the yeare 1562. For they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the doctrine and conſtitution of your Church aſwell as the other, if not alſo more. They are publiklie authoriſed among you aſwell as the other, whether you reſpect the Prelates and Clergy in the Conuocation houſe, or the whole body of the Land in the Parliament. They are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallie receyved profeſſed and practiſed of all the people in every Pariſh and Cathedrall Church throughout the Land, aſwell as the other: Yea and more too, your ſelves being witneſſes. One of your owne Prophets,<note place="margin">Mr Giff. Di. of the strife of the Church. Pag. <hi>100.</hi>
                        </note> writing of your eſtate ſaith, <hi>There be thouſands which be men and women growen, that if a man aſke them how they ſhall be ſaved, they cannot tell.</hi> Neither can your felf deny this to be true. How do they then know and profeſſe the faith of your book of Articles? Or will you ſay, they are as

ignorant of your <hi>Service-book</hi> and of your Prelates other <hi>Articles, Iniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Courts &amp;c.</hi> vnto which they ioyne and ſubmit dayly?</p>
                     <p>Either therefore you muſt meddle with the falſe doctrines and other publik books of your Church, aſwell as with that book of Articles whereof you ſpeak: or els you meddle not at all with the queſtion between vs, neither defend your Churches eſtate. The queſtion between vs is, <hi>Whether the truths you profeſſe together with the falſe doctrines and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Antichriſt retained among you, do make you true Churches and I true Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in that eſtate.</hi> If you keep not to this point, you may make as faire a plea for the Church of Rome and all other Hereticks, whileſt you meddle not with their errors and falſe doctrines, but looke onely at the truths they profeſſe. Mynd but the Papiſts profeſſion concerning Chriſt, and his full and ſufficient ſatiſfaction for all our ſinnes, whereof I ſpake before, <hi>Pag. 47.</hi> And conſider now with your ſelf, how well and ſoundlie you have defended your Churches eſtate.</p>
                     <p>How your doctrine and conſtitution erreth <hi>fundamentally,</hi> I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before, <hi>Pag. 22. 114. 147.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now though you have no liſt to meddle with your Churches do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, yet let vs ſee in your next Reply, if your liſt will be to deale with your owne. Your owne (I ſay) which I had from your ſelf, and take to be private to your ſelf. I had it from you, in a Conference which paſſed “ between you and me,<note place="margin">

Yet for more certainty and better remembrance, I deſired and obteined of you to write it downe your ſelf. So you gave it me then vnder your hand, in writing, which I have with me yet to ſhew. Thus it is, word for word: <q>A power borrowed from Antichriſt to excommunicate, may exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally be committed vnto a people &amp; vſed by them who have power to excommunitate from Chriſt. <bibl>Henry Iacob.</bibl>

                     <p>When you had thus ſet it downe, I deſired your proof of it from the Scriptures. But none could be had: I could not obteine that at your hands. Therevpon I tooke the paper, and wrote vnderneath your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, thus:

in particular adde a word or two more, beſides that which I annexed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the further explication of this point, and conuiction of your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. As firſt, that you do conſider with your ſelves, if with this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble agree not alſo the Apoſtles doctrine, where he calleth the Church <hi>the houſe of God,</hi> and ſaith that <hi>in this houſe</hi> are not onelie veſſels of gold and ſilver, but alſo of wood and earth; and that as ſome of them be for honor, ſo ſome be alſo to diſhonor, from which therefore if anie purge himſelf, he ſhalbe a veſſel vnto honor, ſanctifyed and meet for the Lord, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to every good work. <hi>1 Tim 3.15. &amp; 5.24.25. &amp; 6.3.4.5. &amp; 2 Tim. 2.16.17.18.19.20.21. &amp; 3.5.</hi> Next, that howſoever the parable be vnderſtood by anie, whether of <hi>(1)</hi> the generall eſtate of the Church, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world to the end thereof, how Sathan alway hath <hi>his tares,</hi> his wicked ones (ſometymes more open, ſometymes more ſecret) even as God alway hath his righteous children and ſervants, vntill the day of that finall and everlaſting ſeparacion <hi>(Mat. 13.35.40.): (2)</hi> Or the particular eſtate of the Church, in the tyme of Antichriſts apoſtaſy, wrought by Sathan, vntill the diſcovery and full abolition thereof <hi>(2 Theſ. 2.3.-14.): (3)</hi> Or the Churches continuall being and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verſing in the world, with the children of the wicked: Which they muſt needs do, or els they muſt go out of the world (as the Apoſtle affirmeth, <hi>1 Cor. 5.9.10.).</hi> Howſoever (I ſay) the parable be vnderſtood, whether of theſe or any the like, yet doth it no way make for the receiving or reteining of the knowen wicked (whoſoever they be) in the body of the Church: The ſcope of the parable, by theſe interpretations alſo leading to no ſuch thing: but onelie to comfort and inſtruct the godlie how to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with patience and wiſdome, in ſuch eſtate of things in the world.</p>
                     <p>And the Apoſtle (whoſe doctrine doubtles is not contrarie to Chriſts) teacheth expreſſely, in that place to the Corinthians and the other men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, both that the Church is a diſtinct body ſeparated from the world, not partaking in their evill wayes; and that if anie of the Church will not ſo walk, but commit iniquity, and repent not, that then they be ſo far from being ſuffred to grow or remaine any longer in the Church, as they be forthwith caſt out of it, and delivered vnto Sathan, the Prince of the world and children of diſobedience, even <hi>the Enemy</hi> that ſoweth the tares here ſpoken of. And thus alſo was the Apoſtles practiſe. For both which, that is, both his doctrine and practiſe herein, ſee theſe Scriptures, <hi>1 Cor. 5. chap. &amp; 2 Cor. 2.6-11. &amp; 6.14.-17. Act. 19.9.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:177485:104"/>
to waite patientlie on the Lord, looking for the great harveſt of the world.

                        <hi>Act. 19.</hi> To which you can not replie a word to anie one thing I aunſwered. Onelie you bring ſome new exceptions, but not anie of them all worth a ruſh. You might aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well except, <hi>that Paul was an Apoſtle and a Iew, we not; that the people he dealt withall, were in Aſia, you in Europe; they at Epheſus, you at London &amp;c.</hi> Such pretences, as they are verie common among you, ſo are they moſt abſurd and frivolous, not worthy the hearing or anie refutation at all. Onelie note, that the very Papiſts themſelves may likewiſe alledge againſt anie that witnes the truth vnto them: (yea and do they not dailie thus pretend as you do?) <hi>viz, that they be infinitely many mo, then Paul had there to do withall; 2. That Paul was better able to convince them &amp;c. then any ſuch are the whole Popiſh Church; 3. That there be many learned among them, which have many probable and ſeeming reaſons &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>

Name but one Reaſon (if you can) to which we have not given aunſwer, to the ſtopping of all your mouths. But in deed <hi>(Mr Iacob)</hi> you and your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes have let the * the Prelates and their proctours inſult over you,<note place="margin">Bancroft. Bilſon.

You that ere while cryed out ſo earneſtlie againſt dumbe dogs, are now become dumbe your ſelves, not moving the tounge againſt anie that writeth for the Hierarchy and leitourgy of Antichriſt retained among you. But (to leave this to your ſelves to be better mynded hereafter) tell me now, if it were anie thing to the purpoſe, though that you ſay here were true?

alſo ſay ſo vnto you? Yea and did not the Iewes (think you) ſay ſo vnto Paul? Why then are you ſo partiall againſt vs? But for vs it ſkils not, what you or they think of our cauſe, vnles you ſpeak according to the Law and teſtimony of God: which is far from you.</p>
                     <p>Let the Reader alſo note here, the maner of your ſpeach. You ſay, <hi>that which we hold for truth, they hold to be errors &amp; ſchiſme. They</hi> (ſay you) as ſpeaking of others, not of your ſelf. You belike do not ſo hold it, as they do, but are perſwaded it is truth, and not error. Why then do you not obey and practiſe it? Why are you become our ennemy for bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring witnes vnto it? Why are you ſo partiall againſt vs in it?</p>
                     <p>Towching the eſtate of <hi>the Iewes Church,</hi> I ſhewed three reaſons why the Apoſtles neither did nor might wholy ſeparate from them at firſt. Againſt which you are not able to open your mouth.<note place="margin">

For towching this (which is the queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween vs) here he prayed God <hi>to be mercifull to them, as to him ſelf in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of all his ſinnes.</hi> Now I ſuppoſe you will not denie but his ſinnes (as alſo the ſinnes of all Gods people) deſerve in their owne nature the curſe of God, if they were not forgiven in Chriſt.

                        <hi>4.</hi> His ſpeach in examination before <hi>Mr Fanſhaw,</hi> why do you not ſet it downe in his owne words, as you did the other before? Belike you ſee your ſelf, it is againſt you, howſoever you would pretend otherwiſe. That all may know it, thus it was. Mr <hi>Fanſhaw</hi> aſked him this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Do the Martyrs teach you, that there is no Church in England?</hi> Mr <hi>Penry</hi> anſwered, <hi>If you meane by a Church (as the moſt do) that publik profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherby men do profeſſe ſalvation to be had by the death and righteouſnes of Ieſus Chriſt, I am free from denying any Church of Chriſt to be in this Land. For I know the doctrine of the holy Trinity, the natures and offices of the Lord Ieſus, free iuſtification by him, both the Sacraments &amp;c. publiſhed by her Maieſtyes authority and commaunded by her Lawes, to be the Lords bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and vndoubted truths, without the knowledge and profeſſion whereof no ſalvation is to be had.</hi> Theſe are his words. By which you may ſee he ſaith no other thing here, then what he ſpake in his Confeſſion before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected. So as the anſwer given for it, may ſerve for this alſo. Or if that pleaſe you not, you may mynd it thus, If he had ben demaunded by <hi>Mr Fanſhaw whether there were no Church of Chriſt in Rome:</hi> and had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered thus, <hi>If you meane by a Church, that publick profeſſion whereby men do profeſſe Chriſt Ieſus, by nature to be truly both God and man, that one eternall Prieſt and Redeemer which by his ſacrifice and death vpon the croſſe hath reconciled vs to God, and payed his blood as a full and ſufficient raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome

                        </note> 
                        <hi>then am I free from denying any Church of Chriſt to be in Rome.</hi> If (I ſay) to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion he had thus aunſwered, would you have concluded vpon his words, <hi>that he acknowledged the Church of Rome to be the true Church of Chriſt, or the members thereof to be true Chriſtians, in their conſtitution?</hi> Or do you ſee for the Church of Rome, but not for your owne, that ſuch conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can not be preſſed out of his words?</p>
                     <p>But yet further, for the more clearing of this matter, let vs marke what <hi>Mr Fanſhaw</hi> next aſked, and he aunſwered, towching the eſtate of <hi>your Church</hi> and <hi>his ſeparation</hi> from it. Vpon his former aunſwer <hi>Mr Fanſhaw</hi> ſaid thus vnto him, <hi>Seing you acknowledge that her Maieſty hath eſtabliſhed the truth in ſo many waighty points, ſeing ſhe hath commaunded the true Sacraments to be adminiſtred, what miſlike you in our Church, and why will you not be partaker of theſe truths and Sacraments with vs?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr <hi>Penry</hi> anſwered, <hi>I miſlike 1. the falſe eccleſiaſticall offices; 2. the maner of calling vnto the offices; 3. a great part of the works wherein theſe falſe offices are imployed; 4. the maintenance or livings whereby they are maynteined in their offices. All which I will be bound to prove (by the Lords help) to be derived, not from Ieſus Chriſt, but from the kingdome of Antichriſt his great enemy. And therefore foraſmuch as I can not be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the former holy things of God, but I muſt be ſubiect vnto the power of Antichriſt in theſe officers, and knowen by thoſe marks whereby his ſubiects are noted, therefore I am enforced &amp; bound to ſeek the comfort of the word and Sacraments where I may have them without the ſubmitting of my ſelf vnto any eccleſiaſticall power in Religion, ſave onely vnto that which is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Chriſt Ieſus the Lord, in whom all fulnes of power dwelleth (Col. 1.19.) and from whom all thoſe muſt derive their power and office, vnto whom the Saincts of God are to ſubmit their conſciences to be wrought vpon in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Againe, ſeing the aforenamed 4. enormityes of this Church, are marks which properly belong vnto the Kingdome of the Beaſt, that is, the Romane Antichriſt, we dare not have any communion and fellowſhip with them, nor be knowen by them, leaſt we ſhovld be partakers of thoſe moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; moſt dreadfull iudgements, which are denounced by the Spirit of God, againſt all thoſe that have communion with any of the irreligious inventions of the Beaſt. Rev. 14.9.10. Theſe are the things, together with the want of Chriſts true order, which I eſpecially miſlike, and the ſpeciall cauſes why I dare not ioyne with the Aſſemblyes of this Land &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus was his aunſwer. In which you may ſee, how he profeſſeth your Church offices and eſtate to be ſuch as he dare not ioine therewith, both becauſe they are not derived from CHRiſt IEſus the LOrd of his Church, and for that they belong to the kingdome and body of Antichriſt, and are marks of that Beaſt againſt which and all that partake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God hath denounced moſt fearfull iudgements in his word. Vnto theſe moſt playne declarations of his mynd, I might adde many mo out of his letters and other writings. But what needeth it, whenas the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:177485:108"/>
downe of his life in teſtimony againſt the Antichriſtian eſtate of your Church, is and will be alway as a thouſand witneſſes againſt you, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you pretend otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>And now <hi>(Mr Iacob)</hi> let me vpon this occaſion aſke you this queſtion, whether you think <hi>Mr Barrow, Mr Greenwood, Mr Penry, &amp;c.</hi> dyed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and witneſſes of the truth againſt your Antichriſtian eſtate; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you account them evill doers, iuſtlie deſerving to be put to death. The thing is a publik actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth the publik ſtate of your Church which you would ſeem to defend. Therefore is it needfull that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare your mynd fullie and plainlie therein: which yet I think you will be loth to do. You love ſo to walke in darkenes: and yet would ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your Church, when in deed you do nothing leſſe.</p>
                     <p>Next you alledge <hi>myne owne acknowledgement to Mr Philips and your ſelf</hi> for the approbation of your eſtate. Of which, being alſo obiected before, I have ſpoken already, <hi>Pag. 41.</hi> To it therefore I refer you.</p>
                     <p>Yet before I end this point, I will note here three things more, for the Reader to obſerve. The firſt is, towching <hi>Mr Barrow, Mr Penry, and my ſelf,</hi> that ſeing you ſpare not to wreſt our words, whoſe meaning all men know and our owne practiſe proclaymeth, we can not therefore look for any other at your hands but that you will much more pervert the Scriptures and word of God, about the meaning whereof men make ſo manie doubts and controverſyes from tyme to tyme.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, towching your owne words in theſe Replyes: That whereas in the Concluſion of your firſt Reply <hi>(Pag. 156.)</hi> you ſayd, <hi>we our ſelves acknowledged your Aſſumption to be true:</hi> now in the Concluſion of your ſecond Reply <hi>(Pag. 167.)</hi> you chaunge your owne words, and ſay, <hi>we acknowledged your publik doctrine would and did make many of you true Chriſtians.</hi> By which you cleare vs, and contradict your ſelf. For if your <hi>Aſſumption</hi> were true, then not onelie <hi>many,</hi> but all and every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of your Church, ſhould thereby be deemed true Chriſtians, as tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their outward eſtate: even all your <hi>Prelates, Prieſts, Dumbe dogs, Non-reſidents, Thieves, Coniurers. &amp;c.</hi> Which you may ſpeak with ſhame ynough. Sure I am, none of vs did ever acknowledge it, and I truſt never ſhall.</p>
                     <p>The third is concerning ſome things ſpoken to me, in the preſence of others, at one tyme by <hi>Mr Philips</hi> (whom here you name) and at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tyme by <hi>your ſelf.</hi> Of <hi>Mr Philips,</hi> when once he had ſpeach with me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our cauſe, I aſked, <hi>If her Maieſty ſhould permit, both that way wherein the Prelates and you now are, and the way wherein we are, to be free for all men to walke in eyther of them as they ſhould be perſwaded, In which of the two then he would walke himſelf, as being perſwaded it was the truth of God:</hi> Wherevnto he aunſwered, <hi>that then he thought he ſhould walke in the way wherein we are.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of <hi>your ſelf</hi> alſo among other things once I aſked this, <hi>Whether you were ſo mynded for the Miniſtery which Chriſt hath appointed in his Church,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:177485:109"/>
as you thought you ought and would dy for it, God aſſiſting you:</hi> To which you anſwered, <hi>Yea.</hi> Therevpon preſentlie I aſked agayne, <hi>Whether you were ſo mynded for the Miniſtery of the CHurch of ENgland, as you thought you ought &amp; would alſo dy for it:</hi> To which you anſwered, <hi>No.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If now <hi>(Mr Iacob)</hi> I would preſſe concluſions out of <hi>Mr Philips</hi> words and your owne, as you do out of myne and others: might I not gather from your ſelves (far better then you do or can anie thing from vs) that in your conſciences you ſee your Churches eſtate and Miniſtery to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, and none of Chriſts at all? But I ſpare you.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Martyrs</hi> (whom next you alledge) I ſhewed to be againſt you by <hi>their owne teſtimony.</hi> Vnto this you anſwer, <hi>That it maketh ſtronger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, ſeing although they miſliked the Hierarchy, yet they themſelves refuſed not to communicate and partake with them then as true Chriſtians; as Hooper, Bale, Bradford, &amp;c.</hi> But are you in deed ſo ſimple, as not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyve that this is of no moment at all? What if the Papiſts ſhould ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, when we bring againſt them the teſtimonie of the auncient <hi>Martyrs,</hi> towching the Maſſe, the Hierarchy, Auricular confeſſion, and other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of that Church? Or are you ignorant that<note n="*" place="margin">See before, Pag. <hi>44.45.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Iohn Hus, Iohn wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kleffe, William Swinderby</hi> and manie other of the Martyrs in elder tyme did in theſe things communicate with the Popiſh Church vnto their dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day? If this aunſwer then be frivolous for them in ſuch caſe, how ſhould it not be likewiſe in yours? Beſides that you may by this reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perſwade aſwell to communicate with the Popiſh Church in their Maſſe and Miniſtery, as with yours in your worſhip and Hierarchy.</p>
                     <p>But further, by this aunſwer you yeeld, <hi>that the Martyrs ſpake and wrote againſt your Church eſtate.</hi> Which being ſo, whether do you or we (I pray you) the better? You in following the error of their practiſe? Or we in receyving the truth of their teſtimonie? And then if all that you ſay be graunted, is it ought but this, that you have the weaknes and ſinne of their practiſe, for a cloke of your ſtanding in evill: whereas we have the truth and ſoundnes of their iudgement, for our walking in that which is good? Now let others iudge, which of vs follow them beſt, and have the beſt intereſt in them. And let it alſo be mynded, that they then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming newlie out of the darknes of Poperie, and being exerciſed alſo with other points of that religion, neither did nor could ſo conſider of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as ſynce their tyme in this clearer light it hath in our dayes ben diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed.</p>
                     <p>Laſtlie, if you will have this anſwer of yours go for currant, then will I by like reaſon prove, that you may alſo ſubmit to the Popes authority, and receive all the corruptions of the Romiſh Church. And albeit that which I have alreadie ſaid of the auncient Martyrs before, be ſufficient for proof hereof, yet will I ſhew it you further, thus: The Proteſtants (you know) do vſually alledg againſt the Popes Antichriſtian authority and other corruptions of that Church, the ſayings of <hi>Bernard, Beda, &amp;c.</hi> Suppoſe now the Papiſts ſhould anſwer as you do here, <hi>This maketh
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:177485:109"/>
ſtronger againſt you, ſeing for all that, yet they themſelues refuſed not to yeeld to the Popes ſupremacy, and to partake with this Church, as being Chriſts, &amp;c.</hi> What would you reply againe? Either you muſt ſay (as the truth is) that this anſwer is wandring and frivolous: or els you muſt needs confeſſe, that by this reaſon of yours you may alſo receive the Pope and all that popery which is alreadie caſt out of England, and communicate therewith. Which I pray God be not the iſſue of this your pleading for and partaking with the remnants of Antichriſt yet held in your Church.</p>
                     <p>To that where I demaunded, <hi>If it were ſo that the reformed Churches, we our ſelves, and the Martyrs of former tyme, had given allowance of your preſent eſtate and Church-conſtitution, what would this help you, when as the word of God condemneth you &amp;c.</hi> You aunſwer, <hi>that thoſe witneſſes are ſufficient for this, that we hold a Paradox.</hi> So the teſtimony of Man (if you had it) is of more force with you, then the warrant of Gods word. And whatſoever the Scripture ſaith, yet to you it is a <hi>Paradox,</hi> if it be gainſaid by the reformed Churches <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Bluſh for ſhame <hi>Mr Iacob,</hi> and fear any more to publiſh ſuch godles aſſertions and ſhameles <hi>Paradoxes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All your clipping and perverting of my words will not help you. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your new ſupply <hi>of the whole Churches iudgement &amp; practiſe, with all the auncient learned Fathers, theſe 1300 or 1400 yeares, Chriſoſtome, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius, Nazianzen, Hierom, Auſten, Ambroſe &amp;c.</hi> As if they had knowen and practiſed the Antichriſtian abominations now had in your Church. But when you bring proof of this your laviſh ſpeach, it will then be tyme ynough to aunſwer it. In the meane tyme heare what <hi>Mr Tindall</hi> that faithfull Martyr ſayd (ſpeaking of the Prelates and Prieſts in his age, for their ſo alledging the Fathers as you do). <hi>As for the holy Doctors</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as Auguſtine, Hierome, Cyprian, Chryſoſtomus and Bede, will they not heare. If they wrote any thing negligently (as they were men) that draw they cleane contrary to their meaning, and thereof triumphe they. Thoſe Doctors knew of none authority that one Biſhop ſhould have above another, neyther thought or once dreamed that ever any ſuch ſhould be.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is <hi>Mr Tindall</hi> his ſpeach and obſervation. Which you may mynd. I note it now for this, that you may ſee how your Forefathers alledged the Doctors, and how it ſtands you vpon, well to mynd what proof is brought from them, whether it be for this point (which here he nameth) or for anie other corruptions of Antichriſt retayned among you. Some of which I have rehearſed * before in particular,<note place="margin">Pag. <hi>63.</hi> &amp;c.</note> for which I will expect your proof from ſuch antiquity as you ſpeak of, <hi>ad Kalendas Graecas,</hi> in deed never. And yet I know that both <hi>1400</hi> yeares ſynce, and before alſo, they began to declyne very much. But Antichriſt notwithſtanding came not of a long tyme after, to that height and impiety, wherein now he is to be ſeen and felt both in your Church, and in your mother of Rome.</p>
                     <p>Note alſo, that when all is ſaid that can be in this matter, it is but a <hi>Popiſh ſhift</hi> to fly from the Scriptures to the Fathers; and an impious <hi>Paradox</hi> to exalt their ſayings (who are knowen to have erred in manie
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:177485:110"/>
things) above the word of God, which alone is the rule of truth, and can not lye at all.</p>
                     <p>Finally you ſay, <hi>that to try you I propound a many of queſtions.</hi> Yet they are but ſeven in all. In deed I think it doth and will <hi>try</hi> both you and your fellow Prieſts to aunſwer them. Such <hi>ſuperfluous ſtuffe</hi> they are. And have you not read too,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iob.</hi> 32.3.</note> how ‡ <hi>Iobs frends condemned him, and yet could fynd no anſwer?</hi> Apply it to your ſelves and your dealing with vs. But you ſay you would <hi>firſt have vs cleare this preſent queſtion and our reaſons thereabout.</hi> Well: beſides that is already done, the deciding of theſe few queſtions will fully and plainly do it. Let others iudge if it would not. And mynd you then what you have anſwered. To ſhut vp all, you tell vs aforehand <hi>you have no leyſure to meddle further.</hi> Very like ſo. You have leyſure ynough, to write book after book, to no purpoſe: yet you have not ſo much as to aunſwer a few ſhort queſtions, which may end all the controverſie between vs. He that can not ſee how you would ſhift of the matter, and yet labour to withold the truth in vnrighteouſnes, what doth he ſee? The Lord open your eyes <hi>(Mr Iacob)</hi> that your ſelf may ſee and mynd it. As for others that be ſeduced by you and the reſt of your Prophets teaching lyes, let them in tyme (afore it be to late) apply vnto you and themſelves in ſuch eſtate, that which is written, <hi>The leaders of the people cauſe them to erre, and they that are led by them are devoured. Eſa. 9.16.</hi> Therefore alſo let them all, even whoſoever feare God and will be aſſured of his mercy, give no reſt to their ſoules, vntill with the Prophet they can ſay in truth of heart, and ſhew it forth in their practiſe, <hi>My portion O Lord, I have ſaid, to keep thy words. I have conſidered my wayes, &amp; turned my feet into thy teſtimonyes. I made haſt, &amp; delayed not, to keep thy commaundements. I have refrayned my feet from <hi>every evill way,</hi> that I might keep thy word. Pſal. 119.57.59.60.101.</hi>

THe Reader is to know that Mr Iacob did at firſt propound this <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon</hi> far otherwiſe. Which ſynce being aunſwered, ſo as he could not defend it againe, he hath now chaunged and propounded it with ſome other termes then before: trying belike if he can any way help himſelf, or his cauſe. Now although both his firſt and laſt be alike in this, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them are of any moment, yet becauſe the former aunſwer here following was made vnto <hi>the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi> as it was firſt propounded (which <hi>Mr Iacob</hi> concealeth) and to the end the Reader may ſee what chaunge he hath made therein: I will here alſo ſet it downe, as himſelf did propound it at the firſt. Which was thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As a couple of ignorant perſons that are contracted together, do think that vnles the Prieſt marry them,</hi>

                        <hi>their mariage is nothing (whereas in truth the contract maketh the marriage): yet being married (though vnlawfully) by a Prieſt, their marringe is notwithſtanding lawfull:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>So the ignorant people that have made choyſe of a Miniſter, do think vnles the Biſhop make him a Miniſter, he is no Miniſter (whereas in deed their choiſe made him a Miniſter): yet being made Miniſter (though vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully) by a Biſhop, his Miniſtery is notwithſtanding lawfull.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="187" facs="tcp:177485:111"/>Thus did Mr Iacob at firſt make his compariſon. In which and the change thereof, let the Reader obſerve and Mr Iacob anſwer theſe things following.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That before in the <hi>Propoſition</hi> or firſt part of the compariſon, he ſpake of <hi>perſons contracted together;</hi> now of perſons <hi>not contracted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That in the <hi>Reddition</hi> or latter part, he ſpake of <hi>ignorant people;</hi> now of <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> Before of ignorant people that <hi>had made choiſe</hi> of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; now of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to chooſe or <hi>meaning to have a Paſtor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That he ſpake before of <hi>any man</hi> generallie for a <hi>Miniſter;</hi> now par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularlie of <hi>a ſufficient man</hi> for a <hi>Paſtor.</hi> Then of a ſuppoſed <hi>lawfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> received afore the <hi>Prelates</hi> do <hi>vnlawfully</hi> make them; now of this <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull</hi> one received afore the other. Then of the <hi>peoples choyſe firſt had,</hi> now of <hi>their mutuall accepting and ioining together</hi> afterward.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That thus chaunging the termes of the <hi>Compariſon,</hi> his aunſwer therefore to the ‡ <hi>Reaſons</hi> firſt brought againſt it,<note n="*" place="margin">The Reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were <hi>7.</hi> hereaf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter ſet down.</note> is even in this reſpect indirect and inſufficient: beſides that it is otherwiſe moſt weak and friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Of which more hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Where now he ſpeaketh of <hi>ſufficient men</hi> for Paſtors, ſet him tell vs plainlie what he thinketh of their <hi>Dumbe Miniſters,</hi> and of the reſt among them othewiſe vnmeet and <hi>inſufficient: viz,</hi> Whether the Dumbe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Formaliſts, have not the ſame <hi>calling of the Prelates,</hi> that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Whether they have not like, and many of them greater <hi>acceptance of the people,</hi> then thoſe he ſpeaketh of have.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Whether they therefore being thus ordeined of the Prelates and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the people, are by the word of God <hi>true and lawfull Paſtors,</hi> to whoſe guyding men may commit their ſoules, and ioine to their publik Miniſtery.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Whether their Churches (as they ſtand) have power to chooſe to themſelves their Miniſters, ſo as being choſen by them they are by the Lawes of their Church their <hi>lawfull Miniſters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. How it is poſſible, <hi>that any ſhould hold mariage by a Prieſt vnlawfull, and yet think that vnles they be ſo married, their mariage is nothing?</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>to hold the Prelates making of Miniſters to be vnlawfull, and yet to think that vnles the Prelates do ſo make them, they are no Paſtors at all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be theirs?</hi> What ſtraunge contradictions be here? Is it poſſible, that theſe things can ſtand together? Or can they ever be reconciled, vnleſſe Mr Iacob think their people be ſo mad, as to hold that no lawfull Mariage or Miniſterie can be had, but by vnlawfull meanes? And conſequently, that whoſoever will marry or become Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, muſt needs ſinne againſt God: Yea ſo, as they know and hold it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do it: and therefore alſo ſinne againſt their owne conſcience.<note place="margin">

And here (to ſpeake of it by the way) let the Reader mynd how wonderfully God hath diſpoſed, that they ſhould by themſelves (in their Statutes, ſpeaches, writings) be called by this name and title of <hi>[Prelates]</hi> which is the very Engliſh of the Greek word vſed by the Apoſtle when he deſcribeth Antichriſt: The word is, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p n="3">3 The Prelate then ſaith to ſuch as be there (be they his Serving me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or any other that happen to come that way), <hi>Good people theſe be they whom we purpoſe God willing, to receive this day vnto the holy Office of Prieſthood &amp;c.</hi>

                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tificall: with an exhortation, an Epiſtle and Goſpell, wherein they abuſe and pervert the Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="5">5.

After other queſtions and aunſwers about the ſufficiency of the Scriptures <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (wherein they condemne themſelves) the Prelate aſketh, <hi>if they will reverently obey their Ordinary and other chief Miniſters of the Church</hi> (that is, the Lordbiſhop of the Dioces where they live, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, Archdeacon, Chauncelor, Commiſſary and the reſt of that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Hierarchy). They make aunſwer againe, every one of them ſaying, <hi>I will ſo do the Lord being my helper.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. Then the Biſhop readeth a prayer for them, <hi>that they may have ſtrength and power to performe the ſame:</hi> and deſireth the congregation, <hi>ſecretly in their prayers to make humble ſupplications to God for the foreſaid things.

                     <p n="8">8. After a while, the Prelate prayeth againe in ſuch wiſe as is ſet downe vnto him <hi>in the book:</hi> being not able belike otherwiſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceive any prayer himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="9">9.

                     <p n="10">10.

It is too bold a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and without knowledge to ſpeak ſo of all. 2. If it were true, yet it were falſe to ſay, our aſſemblies conſiſt of ſuch, or to thinke that whole companies of Chriſtians by ſuch commixtures are made vnholy; prophane, and godles: which is contrary to theſe ſcriptures.

I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. 1. Though many received the Goſpell for the commandements ſake, yet who can ſay, That now they all generally wanted all knowledge, and all faith? The word then having ben in many places taught, very many bookes ſcattered, much conference, daily conſultations and diſputations vſed, and the blood of the Martyrs having preached ſo loud, and ſo lately before. 2. It was not ſo ſudden. There was<note n="”" place="margin">From No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember the <hi>17.</hi> till Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> more then halfe a yeare, for the people to heare, learne and conſider, before the commandement came. So that it can not be counted meer force and compulſion, that at the beginning of our Queenes reigne, brought vs to the truth. 3. I would know, You condemne not (I hope) all reformation commanded and compelled by the Magiſtrate. 2 Chron. 34.32.33. &amp; 33.16. &amp; 15.13.. Seeing therefore, the aſſemblies thus openly, and aduiſedly, ſubmitted to the proclaimed truth, who ſeeth not, but they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed therein their former errors, and profeſſed their preſent faith, and vndertooke a new life from that which before they led, though happely not ſo formallie, nor ſo perfectlie as were to have ben wiſhed.</p>

The notorious, diſſolute, &amp; wicked, ſome were reclaimed, all vndertook another profeſſion, and a new appearance of Chriſtianitie.

Now all this was done, not intollerablie doubtleſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though I graunt weakly and corruptly, &amp; very like euen to your owne receiuing in to your Church at this time: nay more tollerable and more lawfull then yours: who to furniſh onely one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, have received many<note n="*" place="margin">This parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Mr Ia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cob hath not printed: but it was in his written copy which I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> bankrupts, knowen bad men, and very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: yea and ſtill retaine men full of contention, and bitter ſtrife. 1 Cor. 3..3.

                     <p>Therefore ſuch mixtures did not diſanull our Churches then in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>

                     <p>But our Church doeth ſo holde that faith.</p>
                     <p>Therefore they are true Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>The Propoſition onely is doubted. I had thought none ſo deſperate as to deny it: but lately I vnderſtand, you haue denyed it. Hovvbeit for anſvver, I referre you partly to that vvhich here hath bene ſaid before, &amp; eſpeciallie to that vvhich is replyed to your Anſwer in the former Treatiſe: which being well weighed, I doubt not but all indifferent, &amp; Chriſtian mindes will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, our publique Church aſſemblies in England to be true Chriſtians.</p>

YOu have now ten tymes reproched me, and are not aſhamed.

it is not ſo vvith choyſe of Miniſters in the Church, as it is vvith choyſe of parties in mariage.</hi> For Infidels, Idolaters, godles perſons <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may in that eſtate marry togeather: but they are not in that eſtate capable of chooſing and ioyning to a true Miniſter. And therefore your <hi>Compariſon</hi> doth not hold.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Yet the particulars do all of them availe much againſt you, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you pretend to the contrary. The firſt is directlie to the queſtion. For although now (having ſeen my aunſwer) you ſpeak of <hi>Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> yet your compariſon (which was given me to aunſwer) ſpake at firſt of <hi>ignorant perſons,</hi> and thoſe alſo ſuch as might marry togeather. Now you cannot deny but ignorant perſons (be they never ſo <hi>prophane</hi> and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les) may marry one with another. Yet have they not power in ſuch caſe to chuſe a Miniſter. It is your ſelf then that keep not the point, but chop and chaunge the termes of your Argument, as you think may beſt fit your turne.</p>
                     <p>And yet all this chaunging of your hew will avayle you nothing at all, vnles you could prove, <hi>1. That your people in that Church-conſtitution are true Chriſtians: 2. That your Miniſters ſo made and received are true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors.</hi> But neither of theſe can you do. For the firſt, let the Reader ſee the former treatiſe, where this point is purpoſelie handled. (And mynd here that your ſelf confeſſe, <hi>ſome of your Aſſemblies are all and wholy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane godles perſons: Of which</hi> (you ſay) <hi>you ſpeak not:</hi> Yet tell vs whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you think ſuch Aſſemblies be true Churches, ſuch people true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and their Miniſters (hauing like ordering of the Prelates and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the people) true Paſtors, or not.) For the latter, this is the treatiſe and place where you ſhould prove it, if you could. But behold, you do nothing leſſe.<note place="margin">In the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, Pag <hi>186.</hi>

                     <p>That which you ſpeak, <hi>of your Aſſemlies not being all and wholy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and godles perſons,</hi> is nothing to the purpoſe. You might eaſilie have ſeen (if you had mynded the words of my Reaſon) that I ſayd expreſſelie, <hi>your Aſſemblies conſiſt of all ſorts of people,</hi> that is, ſome better, ſome worſe: Yet ſeing the beſt among you remaine in confuſion with the worſt, and all of you in bondage to Antichriſt: that even for this cauſe alſo you can not in that eſtate be deemed true Churches, having power to chuſe ſuch Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers as Chriſt hath appointed for his Church.</p>
                     <p>And where you ſay, <hi>whole companyes of Chriſtians are not by ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtures made vnholy, prophane, and godles,</hi> it is wholy from the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                     <p>That which followeth in the laſt place, for the ſhutting vp of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (when you ſay, <hi>That which diſanulleth not a Church gathered &amp;c.</hi>) is directly againſt your ſelf.

(If we could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that to be a gathering of a Church, which leaveth it ſtill in confuſion with the world and bondage to Antichriſt.) Now that ſuch mixtures with the profane will diſanull Churches before gathered aright, you may ſee by that which is written, <hi>Gen. 6.2. &amp;c. Ezech. 16. chap. and 22.26. and 44.6.7.8. And in the Churches that were at Rome, Epheſus, Corinth, &amp;c. Rev. 13.16. and 17.1. and 18.1. and 18.2. being compared with Rom. 1.7.2.

                     <p>But further, mynd here a contradiction with your ſelf. For now you graunt (which before you denyed) that your Church is commingled of all ſorts of people, having <hi>mixtures</hi> of profane and diſſolute, with the reſt that are better among you.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Scriptures</hi> you quote, I have ſhewed <g ref="char:trefoil">♣</g> before how you do pervert them. <hi>Pag. 195.</hi> And thus much of the ſecond particular.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third was, <hi>that you remaine in bondage to Antichriſtian Offices.

I graunt, <hi>that your peoples conſenting</hi> (whether before or after the Prelates ordeining) <hi>is in nature and valew all one &amp;c.</hi> that is, of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew or force at all: Whether you reſpect the Law of God, which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no ſuch jugling of people and Prelates: or the Law of your owne Church, which appoynteth no ſuch election by the people at all. And thus too it is a very vayne thing for you to make this any matter, <hi>viz, our peoples conſenting eyther before or after the Prelates ordeyning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet remember that your Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon (which I anſwered) ſpake of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that had made choyſe of a Miniſter before he came for ordination to the Prelate. Therefore it was and is ynough againſt the Compariſon, to ſhew that the Prieſts can not celebrate mariage <hi>before</hi> the partyes con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent ech to other: Whereas the Prelates make Miniſters both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>without</hi> the peoples conſent, yea and without their knowledge commonly. It is vayne then in you to count ſuch exception <hi>vayne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I mynd alſo how deceitfully you paſſe by that clauſe <hi>[without the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples conſent.]</hi> Therefore to diſcover your fraud, and to ſee what better anſwer you can give in your next, I will propound the Reaſon alſo thus:<lb/>
The Prieſt doth not celebrate any mariage without the maryed firſt give their conſent.</p>
                     <p>But the Prelates make Miniſters without the peoples conſent. Therefore the Compariſon holdeth not.</p>
                     <p>Your caſe <hi>[of a Mayde being meerly enforced and denying conſent, yet not ſtriving nor reſiſting]</hi> is meerly abſurd and ridiculous. Can it poſſibly
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:177485:125"/>
be, that one ſhould both be meerlie enforced, denying conſent, and yet not ſtrive nor reſiſt? As ſoone may you make Fier and Water agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as theſe two. For, to be enforced, yea meerlie enforced, muſt needs imply a ſtriving or reſiſting againſt it. Els what needed there, or how ſhould there be ſaid, to be anie forcing?</p>
                     <p>But you ſay, <hi>if afterward ſhe agree, there is true wedlock.</hi> True in deed if they both agree. But then it is not by reaſon of anie thing done before (which was ſinfull altogether) but by vertue of the preſent mutuall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling conſent: they having liberty and power to marrie together according to Gods ordinance. But with your people and Aſſemblyes it is far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: ſeing you have not liberty or power in your eſtate to call a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter according to the ordinance of Chriſt. Which I have proved both in the firſt Reaſon before, and in the reſt hereafter following.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2.</hi> To your demaund about <hi>Miniſters firſt choſen by the people afore they are inſtituted by the Prelates:</hi> I aunſwer, that if your people had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in your eſtate to chuſe a Miniſter (which they have not) yet the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of inſtitution and induction by the Prelates afterward (being never ordeined by God) were at leaſt to ſet your threſholds by Gods threſholds that is, your inventions by Gods ordinances. Which were in very deed to commit abomination againſt the Lord, and to defile his holy Name, and you in ſo doing become ſo far from having him preſent with you, as even by this meanes you ſet a wall between him and your ſelves. <hi>Ezech. 43.8.</hi> And not ſo onely, but do alſo rebell againſt the Lord, and turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him, in receiving an other Miniſtery for the adminiſtration of his holy things, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he by his word hath ordeined in his Church. <hi>Ioſ. 22.29.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let the Reader note here beſides, how you ſpeak onelie <hi>of the inſtitution and induction by the Prelates,</hi> and cloſely paſſe over the Prelates firſt ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them <hi>Prieſts and Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</hi> Without which they are in your Church no Miniſters at all, neyther capable of anie benefice, though the people ſhould never ſo much make choyſe of any.</p>
                     <p>Where you ſay, <hi>moſt of your Miniſters have the peoples conſent at their firſt inducting, or at leaſt ſoone after by the peoples <hi>ſubmitting &amp; mainteyning</hi> them even preſently:</hi> Firſt I aunſwer (as before) that your peoples conſent in your eſtate is of no moment. Secondly, if this reaſon of yours be good, then your dumbe Prieſts, Non-reſidents, and moſt Popiſh Miniſters in the worſt tymes and places, are to be accounted true Paſtors, aſwell as the beſt among you: becauſe vpon their inductio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people <hi>ſubmit</hi> to their Miniſtery and mainteyne them even preſently. For who knowes not, that when once a Prieſt is preſented by the Patrone and inducted by the Prelate to a benefice, your people do and muſt joyne to his Miniſtery, and for his maintenance give him their tithes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will they, nill they.</p>
                     <p>Adde herevnto, that even the <hi>maintenance</hi> belonging to your Miniſtery is ſuch, as was never ordeyned by Chriſt: and therefore neither to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Miniſters, nor given by the people. Which I prove thus: <hi>1.</hi> Your Miniſtrrs are mainteyned by Tithes, which is Iewiſh, and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:177485:126"/>
ceaſed with “ the Levitical Prieſthood: Or if you will, Popiſh, derived from the Iewes:<note place="margin">

But for this point it needeth not. For we yeeld it moſt willingly. Yet note withall, that thus you do both give the cauſe, and condemne at once all your Miniſtery as vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſuch as may neither be received nor joyned vnto.

1 VVE deny your ſaying, <hi>the people can not chuſe.</hi> They can chuſe. They have power in Chriſt, as being Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, though they know not their right therein. The ignorance of this ſimply, doth not cut vs of from Chriſt, nor from this holy priviledge: no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the blind Papiſts have loſt their right &amp; power of marrying together without a Prieſt, becauſe they are ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of it.</p>

Againe where you ſay, <hi>But a couple may chuſe each other whether the Prieſt will marry them or no:</hi> Marke, That we ſpeake of blind Papiſts, that thinke that the Prieſt is the whole abſolute and neceſſarie marriage maker. If you ſay, even ſuch have right and power to marry, though they be farre from knowing it, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from practizing; Then graunt the like in chuſing a Miniſter, to our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: for ſo the Compariſon importeth, Els if you meane thoſe words of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that be men of knowledge, Then you fight with your ſhadow: you touch not our queſtion.</p>

YOu do ſtill take for graunted that which is denyed: <hi>viz, that your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have power in Chriſt to chuſe their Miniſters &amp;c.</hi> I proved before that ſeing your people ſtand in Antichriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſervitude to the Prelates, their Canons, Courts, confuſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they have not in that eſtate (neither can have, whiles they ſo remaine) the liberty and power of Chriſt, either to chuſe them Miniſters, or to performe anie other action belonging to the Church of Chriſt. And further that they can not in that eſtate by the word of God be approved true Chriſtians. For which ſee the former Treatiſe.</p>
                     <p>In that you graunt the peoples choyſe to be <hi>an holy priviledge,</hi> you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne both your Church which rejecteth it, and ſuch of your people as ſeem to vſe it, whereas in your eſtate they do nothing els but profane it. Why alſo do not ſuch of you as know theſe things, deliver everie man his ſoule from that ſlaverie wherein ye ſtand vnder the Prelates, that ſo you might enioy and practiſe <hi>the priviledges and holy things of God,</hi> as Chriſt hath given them to his Church?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To that you pretend of ſuch as be <hi>blynd and ignorant,</hi> thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to help your ſelf: I anſwer, that we ſpeak of your people, as now they ſtand in your Church-conſtitution. For ſo (you know) the queſtion is. Now whether they be ignorant, or whether they have knowledge, it ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not for the matter in hand. This we alledge, that none at all of your people or aſſemblyes have, in your eſtate, the liberty and power which Chriſt hath given to his Church: as the other haue for mariage.

NEyther the fourth Reaſon, nor this, nor any other of them are yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Let others judge. And now your ſelf are driven to confeſſe that, this <hi>hath both likelyhood and reaſon againſt your Pluralityes.</hi> Which is in deed to yeeld vnto it. For tell me, if your Pluralitie-men have not (as well as the reſt among you) both the ſome calling by the Prelates, which your Church appointeth; and like acceptance of your people, who joyne vnto them and mainteine them, as you alledged before: <hi>Pag.</hi> 208. The Reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then hath waight not onely againſt your <hi>pluraliſts,</hi> but againſt all your other <hi>Miniſters</hi> too: ſeing they have all of them one and the ſame falſe Miniſtery, received from the Prelates, and executed vnder them,</p>
                     <p>Vnto which you may adde, that the <hi>Miniſtery</hi> of all among you is ſuch as Chriſt never ſet in his Church: whether you look at your <hi>Offices,</hi> from the hyeſt Prelate to the loweſt Prieſt: or at your <hi>Entrance,</hi> according to your Churches Canons and Book of ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; or at your <hi>Miniſtration,</hi> by your Book of common praier and other your Canons and Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: or finally at your <hi>maintenance,</hi> by Tithes, Chriſmes, Offerings <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When you have well mynded theſe things, you ſhall find this Argument reach a great deale further then to <hi>Pluralityes,</hi> even to all the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of your Church in your eſtate. Make a tryal: ſearch the Teſtament of Chriſt throughout, and if you can, ſhew it to be otherwiſe. If not, give glorie to God, and yeeld to the truth.</p>

THe taking of orders from a Prelate, after conſent given to a Miniſter by a people, is not like adultery in mariage: eſpecially where both Paſtor and people are ſimply ignorant of that error. Therefore that diſanulleth not, as adultery doth the wedlok. So this Reaſon is much like to the laſt before, and the anſwer not vnlike to that of the Fourth Reaſon likewiſe. For

YEs Mr Iacob, albeit your peoples <hi>conſent</hi> were the choyſe of a true Church, yet ſuch taking of <hi>the Prelates Orders</hi> were <hi>like adultery.</hi> How much more in your caſe, who have drunke ſo deep of the cup of Babels fornications? Yet you ſay, <hi>theſe two are not alike:</hi> but your ſaying you proue not at all. I do ſtill affirme there is likeliehood between them, and thus I prove it.</p>
                     <p>To receive the Miniſterie of Antichriſt, is to commit ſpirituall whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. (For Antichriſts Miniſterie is part of <hi>the Whores abominations,</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.4.5.)</p>
                     <p>But the taking of Orders from a Prelate, is to receive the Miniſtery of Antichriſt. (Witnes <hi>your Book of ordination,</hi>

                     <p>Therefore the taking of Orders from a Prelate, is to commit ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Whoredome.</p>
                     <p>Now that there is likelyhood and fit Compariſon between <hi>corporall and ſpirituall Whoredome,</hi> the Scripture doth every where teach, and your ſelf Mr. Iacob (I think) will not be ſo ſenceleſſe as to deny it. Even
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:177485:129"/>
here you confeſſe <hi>that your taking of Orders from a Prelate, is an error.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither will the <hi>ignorance</hi> you pretend, help the matter. For although it cannot well be thought, that after ſo open and manifold declaration of the truth, as you have had, you ſhould ſtill be ignorant thereof: yet if it were ſo, your ignorance (you know) will not warrant your action, nor juſtifie your ſinne. Ignorance in deed cauſeth a ſinne to be leſſe, but not to be none at all. Suppoſe that two ignorant perſons, not knowing (or at leaſt pretending not to know) adultery to be vnlawfull, ſhould commit that folly togeather: Were their action therefore not to be deemed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie? Yet thus you reaſon. And your anſwer beſides importeth ſome yeelding to the ſimilitude, as towching them among you which know the truth. Let all ſuch therefore, eſpecially, weigh with them ſelves in what wofull eſtate they remaine wittinglie, even ſuch as is <hi>ſpiritual whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> againſt the Lord.</p>
                     <p>So this Reaſon in deed is <hi>like to the laſt before,</hi> that is, direct and of waight againſt you: and your aunſwer vnto it <hi>not vnlike to that of the Fourth Reaſon and the reſt,</hi> that is, meerlie frivolous and to no purpoſe at all. For <hi>this error</hi> as you call it (that is, your ſubjection to the Prelacy and abominations of Antichriſt yet remaining in your Church) <hi>maketh you in that eſtate eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the firſt vncapable</hi> of chuſing a <hi>Paſtor:</hi> or of entring ſuch <hi>Covenant</hi> as you ſpeak of, or of performing anie other action, by the power and liberty which Chriſt hath given to his Church For what concord hath Chriſt with Antichriſt? Or how can the liberty of Chriſt and bondage of Antichriſt ſtand together,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.21.</note> and the one not expell the other? Or will you alway halt between two opinions, and never make ſtreight ſteps vnto your feet, to turne them into the teſtimonies of the Lord? Be not deceived: God is not mocked. Whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he reap. He that ſoweth to Antichriſt, ſhall with him reap corruption: but he that ſoweth to Chriſt, ſhall by him reap life everlaſting. <hi>2. Theſ. 2.10.11.12.
